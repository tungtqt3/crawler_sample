https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil,5,2022-10-18,Worked for me when steroids didn't,"I developed eczema on my face during my second pregnancy. My baby was breeched, and I was in constant pain - a deep contrast to my first pregnancy. The breakout of eczema began on my chin in the second trimester and would come and go. After giving birth, the eczema took over and I looked like Darth Maul. The intense burning, dryness, and itching was unbearable. My dermatologist said she had no tricks up her sleeve except for a topical steroid and a month long dose of an antibiotic once I stopped breastfeeding. I used the steroid for about 6 months taking the breaks my Derm recommended. Unfortunately, my skin got so thin the eczema got worse and more painful. My eyes felt swollen. I discontinued use of the steroid for good (threw it in the trash) and went back to my routine of cetaphil face wash, then a zinc bar w emu oil, then this Phoenix oil. The eczema disappeared. So, with no steroid and no antibiotic, my skin is beautiful again. I don't even wear makeup on my skin directly. I fill in my brows and apply mascara and lip tint/moisturizer. I will never use a topical steroid again. It almost ruined my face. I will continue to purchase this facial oil and have even gifted it to my mother for her birthday. She is 72 and looks amazing without makeup now. Thank you so much for this product! ",Softer; Hydrated; Glowing; Calmer; Even skin tone,35-44,Dry,"Dryness, Sensitivity"

I have dry, acne prone, slightly sensitive skin.  I like a good dewy, glowing look to my skin, and this oil delivers that glow 110%.

I feel like this is the perfect facial oil for people with dry, mature skin. I will definitely be using this one forever.  In tandem with Moon Fruit my skin is softer & my dark spots are lighter.  10/10 ",Smoother; Softer; Hydrated; Calmer; Glowing,35-44,Dry,"Acne, Dark Spots, Pores, Anti-Aging"

Any time I wash my dog, he obsessively scratches afterward for days to a couple of weeks from dry skin. I've tried multiple products and nothing seemed to work. I was getting to the bottom of my Phoenix oil and thought to try it on my dog's skin to use it up.... it only took a few drops on the areas he was obsessively scratching and rubbing it in before he stopped within minutes. Keep in mind he was scratching so bad, he was leaving clumps of fur on the carpet and would scratch throughout the night. I felt so bad for him on top of waking me up constantly. It doesn't take much but applying it close to the skin and rubbing it in works like magic. Guess you can say the Phoenix oil is for the whole family! Some might say it's an expensive solution but a dozen or so drops is a lot cheaper than how much I was spending trying to find a solution.... plus a few drops is well worth my dog's comfort and my sleep.

I tried the Lapis oil before and I did like it but I was looking for something with more anti-aging benefits since I’m in my mid-thirties now. This oil is just perfect in every way.

I don't even want to think about how much money I've spent over the years buying products that haven't worked. Lately the flaky skin has been awful on my nose due to wearing masks. I have raw patches on my nose that seem to never heal, just continually flake.

I started using one drop each of the Phoenix, Emerald, and Lapis oils after my moisturizer at night. In the morning I do the same thing, but before my moisturizer because that one has SPF and I don't want to rub it away. 
My skin has changed DRAMATICALLY in only 3 days! Zero new zits, my skin absolutely glows, and my scabs/raw patches have already healed so much!

I put an extra drop of Phoenix oil on my nose, and it's so hydrating and soothing. I burned my arm on the oven recently, and this oil has been soothing and healing the burn so well.

I'm so relieved to have found these products that I want to cry. I'm finally on my way to the skin I've always wanted. The oil is very rich and concentrated, so don't be scared of the cost.

It contains 1% of bakuchiol. Some of the star ingredients is quinoa plant peptides, and honey locust seed extract, which helps to reduce fine lines and hydrating. The eye cream comes in a glass jar, the cream has a beautiful hue of light purple. The texture was a little stiffer than I thought. It’s doesn’t have a creamy texture like I’m use to. It sort of reminds me a of cold stick of butter.  But it’s super easy to use, the formula itself is quite easy to apply. It goes on smooth and absorbs fast. Feels like I can use it during the day due to the light weight texture. It leaves my eye area hydrated and soft. It does not irritate my eyes.  I have been using it for a couple of night and my dark circles look a little lighter. Looking forward to continue to use this eye cream.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/moon-fruit-retinol-alternative-sleep-mask,5,2022-03-01,Soft Plump Skin,"Honestly, Herbivore is my favorite company for natural products that I use in conjunction with my homemade products. People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, moon fruit, prism face mask, brighten face mask, and tansy face mask). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that. I’m new to using Moon Fruit but immediately felt like my skin just soaked it in and felt more hydrated and plump — can’t wait to see the results over long term use.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/moon-fruit-retinol-alternative-sleep-mask,5,2022-02-04,Over the Moon for Moonfruit!,"Ok, I know, silly pun, but this stuff is seriously awesome. For reference, I have acne-prone, dehydrated and sensitive skin that is super picky about what I use. This did not break me out, sinks into my skin and hydrates it deeply and no irritation whatsoever. I've been using it every other night and that seems to work perfectly for me. On the other nights, I use the Cloud Jelly Serum with Orchid oil on top. As I've gotten older (I am now in my mid 30's), my skin has gotten increasingly dehydrated but somehow still oily sometimes? It's very weird. This is the product I have been waiting for to care for my dry/dehydrated skin in the winter. Bonus– It smells so yummy, like berries. I cannot speak to the anti-aging affects of the Bakuchiol in the product as I don't really have any wrinkles yet. I will say though, that it does seem to help with texture. I hope Herbivore keeps this mask forever as it is officially part of my everyday skin care routine. Thank you Herbivore for making such clean, effective and amazing products!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/moon-fruit-retinol-alternative-sleep-mask,5,2022-01-16,"Rich moisturizer, perfect for winter",The only thing that frustrated me about this product was that there was no guidance included about how frequently to use it - nightly? Weekly? I think it could be as much as works for you. I have combo/sensitive skin that tends to get dry in winter. Every 2-3 nights seems perfect for me in winter. I alternate with the bakuchiol serum on other nights.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/moon-fruit-retinol-alternative-sleep-mask,5,2022-01-12,My New Favorite!,"I’ve recently started using sleep masks and have been loving them. When I saw Herbivore launched a new sleep mask that was an updated version of a product I had tried and loved previously, I ordered right away. I love the updated version even better than the original. The texture, scent, and ingredients are just fabulous and although it is a thick rich cream it absorbs really well without any greasy residue. I followed their advice and do not use with oils so I just apply this in lieu of a moisturizer after my serum. I did notice an immediate difference in my skin after just one use. My breakouts were diminished, and my skin texture and tone was improved. I can’t wait to see the results with long-term use of the product because it typically takes 6-8 weeks to really visualize the full benefits of a new product. Thanks Herbivore for another great product!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/moon-fruit-retinol-alternative-sleep-mask,5,2022-01-08,I’m in love!,"I was a little hesitant to try this, because they warn of possible irritation. I’ve had no irritation whatsoever. I do alternate nights I use it, cause my skin can be ridiculously sensitive. But I’m absolutely in love with this mask. As another reviewer said, you can skip your regular moisturizer and just use this after your serum. No oils though, because it will pill. You don’t need anything but this. I have cystic acne along my jaw line, along with early aging skins. It is tackling both problems. It dries up acne, but it’s no way drying. I don’t know how it works, I just know I can’t live without it! 
Would love you see a bakuchiol eye cream next!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/moon-fruit-retinol-alternative-sleep-mask,5,2021-12-26,Maybe my new favorite,"I was really excited to see this with 1% bakuchiol and it so high up on the ingredients list. It didn't disappoint. Now I've only used this for 3 nights so far but short term results have been had. My nightly routine has been all herbivore products: pink jelly face wash, prism serum, emerald oil for awhile. Nothing has ever cleared up my acne prone skin as well as consistent use of those 3 products. Adding this did wonders. I had missed several nights of skincare during a stressful travel experience and it showed. The state my skin was in, it usually takes 1 to 2 weeks of nightly use to get it back to clear and even with the 3 aforementioned products. I applied this mask over the prism serum and left out the emerald oil and this mask did a week's worth of overhaul on my skin. There was a slight pleasant tingling after applying it and my face was so soft the next morning when I rinsed. I did this the following night and a third time but without the prism serum and my skin is blowing my mind. The moonfruit smells super good too. It's definitely moisturizing enough to use it sans moisturizer and I have dry skin. Cleared up acne and unevenness so quickly I hope this product stays around!",,,,

But I discovered herbivore by accident and loved everything I’d purchased, and when I found out about this oil, I knew I had to give it a try. I use this after my moisturizer, as the very last step in my nighttime skincare routine, and for once in life since I was a pre-teen, my skin isn’t an oily greasy mess! I wake up with normal skin each morning, and I’m no longer dripping oil everywhere throughout the day. My skin is balanced and healthy, and my acne is healing so quickly too. I will forever swear by this oil. ",Clearer; Calmer; Even skin tone; Softer; Hydrated,18-24,Oily,"Acne, Oiliness, Sensitivity"

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2022-02-17,Impressed!,"I've waited about a month and a half to write this, as I wanted to see how this product worked over time. For years I've suffered from large pores, hormonal acne, combination skin, and just general unevenness of skintone/texture on my face. I saw this in an ad and bought the sample bottle to try. I've applied three drops (forehead and each cheek) morning and evening for the last month and a half or so, and let me just say, nothing - not even prescription cleansers/creams - has ever come close to what Lapis has done for me. Within a week, my skintone and texture had evened to the point where I stopped wearing foundation. My skin is smooth, pores are less visible, and the color is even and has a certain healthy glow to it that it's never had before. Since I've started using it, I have had zero acne. None. Not a single pimple, hormonal or otherwise. Oiliness has improved. It may be a bit drying in a couple areas, but it's not bad at all. Overall, I am extremely impressed (and boggled) by this stuff. Amazing product!",Brighter; Smoother; Improved blemishes; Clearer; Even skin tone,25-34,Combination,"Acne, Dryness, Oiliness, Pores"
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2022-02-07,This is a game changer!,"As a heads up, I am not one of those fake paid reviews I just want to rave about this product lol. I am someone who gets acne from any skincare product regardless of formulation. Anti-acne, sensitive, etc... will absolutely give me acne and I had basically given up looking at skincare because I was so tired of having acne and everything just made it so much worse. When I saw this product I was very interested in trying it but the price tag made me stall for a bit because in my mind why would I pay that much to give myself more acne. Finally breaking down considering the incredible reviews this product has gotten, I splurged on the big bottle. I could have bought the mini or the smaller bottle to try the product without spending so much, but on the chance that this product worked I wanted the full size and WOW, am I glad I bought the big  bottle! Within the first week I was in love with this oil. I was in the shower noticing that all the small milia bumps and clogged pores trapped under the skin were completely gone, just GONE! The second week I noticed that the light rosacea I have was also diminished by I'd say 95% and my pores and the spaces between the pores looked so much better than they ever have in my entire life I wanted to cry actual tears of joy because I feel so good about my skin now. This oil is so light and airy, it completely sinks into my skin within minutes and does not leave me feeling even a little bit greasy. Some people complained about the 'medicinal' smell, but once it's dry I don't smell it at all and it's just camphor in the blue tansy that you're smelling so it's not an unnatural fragrance. Knock on wood, in the three weeks of once daily use(the bottle says do it twice, but I only do it once before bed after toning with witch hazel) of this oil I have not gotten a single pimple. If I noticed a bump, it was not red and it disappeared within a day. I am looking in a mirror now which is what encouraged me to make this review because I can't believe the difference this product made on my skin. If you have doubts if this product will work for you, try it anyways. I am so glad I tried this, it has literally changed my life and skin in such a quick time frame I'm still shocked it can even be real.

Herbivore, thank you! This incredible oil is the ONLY product in my 32 years to improve my skin and not make it worse.

I have used it every day with zero side effects and I'm thrilled to have found a great alternative!

That being said, I am also glad that Herbivore finally launched a product with a clinical percentage of bakuchiol vs. the product titled Bakuchiol, which does not contain a clinical dosage of bakuchiol nor does it contain straight bakuchiol.

I’ve been using the new MOON FRUIT for 5 nights now and already not only saw results on the first night, but more importantly, felt the results. It’s important to visibly see a product working, but when you can feel it working, that takes your confidence boost from 100% to 110%. My skin felt more plump, smooth, evened out with vibrancy!

I will be using it for 30 days straight and I'm honestly so excited to see where my acne scars are at by day 30. 

My skin is acne prone and sensitive, common retinol products can be irritating and cause acne flare ups. Moon Fruit has actually HELPED my acne instead of causing it. Bakuchiol is natures Retinol, but better (in my opinion).  I've been pairing Moon Fruit with Phoenix oil and my skin is G L O W I NG. 

In the morning, I use 3 drops of Moon Fruit serum, all over my face & neck.  I let that sink into my skin for about 5 minutes before applying 2 drops of Phoenix oil in a patting motion, not rubbing. 

At night, I do the same but with an extra drop or two for added moisture. When I wake up my skin is soft & glowing.  I genuinely and honestly can't believe how well these products are working for me.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/moon-fruit-1-bakuchiol-peptides-retinol-alternative-serum,5,2022-04-15,Fun Purple Color,"I was kindly gifted by Herbivore their Moon Fruit Serum, which is made up of Bakuchiol and Peptides, in exchange for my honest review.  This is nature’s retinol. I love the fun purple color of this serum.  The packaging is simple yet elegant.  The pump bottle is nice.  The cap twists to open or close which is handy if you take it on-the-go for preventing leaks.  The serum itself has a nice consistency.  It is not too thin and watery and not too thick like lotion, but somewhere in between.  It absorbs well without any stickiness or residue.  It has a slight scent that reminds me of grapes (maybe that is due to the purple color).  It was not irritating to my skin at all.  It is moisturizing and helps relieve my face from dryness. I would recommend this serum to help minimize fine lines and to help with the loss of firmness.

I love that it sinks right into my skin without any stickiness or greasiness. Immediately my skin feels soft and smooth as well as hydrated.

People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, and moon fruit). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that.

Like all retinol/retinol alternative products, it takes 8-12 weeks before you start seeing results. And let me tell you - I have! While pores don't actually shrink (fact, sorry), this product has significantly helped smooth my skin's texture and has helped clear congestion in my pores. I didn't experience any breakouts with this and my skin always feels so soft and refreshed in the morning (since I apply at night).

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil,5,2022-03-01,The Perfect Glow,"Honestly, Herbivore is my favorite company for natural products that I use in conjunction with my homemade products. People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, moon fruit, prism face mask, brighten face mask, and tansy face mask). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that. Orchid is the perfect moisturizing oil that brings a beautiful glow to my skin. ",Smoother; Hydrated; Brighter; Glowing; Even skin tone,35-44,Normal,Anti-Aging

I got a sample of it in a Sephora order and fell in love. To me it smells SO GOOD first of all, very herbal and fresh and slightly medicinal but in a good way. It also lasts a long time as a little goes a long way - I got 4 uses out of a little sample envelope! I have pretty sensitive skin but I've been using this daily for a month with no negative effects and the jar hardly looks like it's been touched. It's really helped cut down on breakouts and even out my overall skin texture, which was pretty rough and bumpy in places. I also have very red cheeks and almost every product I try makes them worse, but this actually seems to soothe them! I get CRAVINGS to use this mask lol, it's become an absolute staple in my routine.

This mask was so pleasant and luxurious to use, and I noticed significant improvement in my skin as soon as I rinsed it off. My skin continued to improve as the afternoon went on.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/emerald-deep-moisture-glow-oil,5,2022-03-01,The Most Perfect Glow,"Honestly, Herbivore is my favorite company for natural products that I use in conjunction with my homemade products. People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, moon fruit, prism face mask, brighten face mask, and tansy face mask). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that. Emerald is one of my top 3 faves that will always be my go to. It leaves my skin bright and glowing. ",Brighter; Glowing; Smoother; Hydrated; Even skin tone,35-44,Normal,Anti-Aging

My 7 year old has extremely painful eczema and psoriasis flare ups. Medicated lotions sting and are painful when he has an active flare up. I decided to try the oil after reading reviews and OMG not only was it painless but it was cleared up by morning. I was in tears so thankful.

This moisturizer was it! The texture is light, almost synthetic (in a good way??). The scent is mild and pleasant. I use 2 drops twice a day and ran out in 6 months. It's perfect for me in the Summer when my face tends to be more oily. I want something a little heavier for Winter, though, as my skin is dryer and I have to use 3 drops instead, which uses up the product faster. I would highly recommend to people with oily or combination skin. I wouldn't recommend to people who have dry skin unless you don't mind spending $50 every 3 months on face oil.",,25-34,Combination,Acne

the friction had caused my sensitive skin to develop cystic acne and skin infections. This led to some pretty gnarly scarring and hyperpigmentation. I got the active breakouts under control, but the dry skin and healing itch was out of control! Quarter sized spots healing on my cheeks that I just wanted to scratch off. I got this in an Ipsy box and was desperate to try anything for relief. The first night I used it, I firstly liked the texture and how nice it felt on the skin. I used it on its own to see how my skin would react overnight. The next day my skin already felt a bit less itchy and it looked so much less irritated. After a week, most of the inflammation was gone, the itching was gone, and my skin seemed to be having a much easier time healing in general. Now, I’m about two months in with a bit of sporadic use. But I still love it. My skin texture looks great, I’m moisturized, no more break outs, most of my hyperpigmentation had faded, and with the exception of some unfortunate pitting, there’s almost no trace of the medical malady that was there only weeks before. I can’t swear it will do the same for you, nor what all can be attributed to just the oil.

The second one, I put it on and my face feels clean, refreshed, and my skin just drinks it up. 
I am not the kind of person who gravitates towards oils because I have highly oily T-zone and still have acne prone skin. There’s absolutely NOTHING for me to complain about HERBIVORE products.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/emerald-deep-moisture-glow-oil,5,2021-08-07,So soothing,"I got this in the jewel box and I love it!

I have tricky skin. I get small zits and clogged pores, but nothing cystic. The zits turn to little scabs that seem to never heal. It can take over a month sometimes, and I hate it. Unfortunately my skin is also extremely dry, but whenever I try to add moisture I break out more. I don't even want to think about how much money I've spent over the years buying products that haven't worked. Lately the flaky skin has been awful on my nose due to wearing masks. I have raw patches on my nose that seem to never heal, just continually flake.

I started using one drop each of the Phoenix, Emerald, and Lapis oils after my moisturizer at night. In the morning I do the same thing, but before my moisturizer because that one has SPF and I don't want to rub it away.

My skin has changed DRAMATICALLY in only 3 days! Zero new zits, my skin absolutely glows, and my scabs/raw patches have already healed so much! I'm 31 and starting to get some fine lines on my forehead, and they're already less noticeable. I think it's because of how well this oil is hydrating and plumping my skin.

Emerald oil is especially great at bringing down any redness and irritation on my skin, as well as improving flaking. Like all 3 of the jewel box oils it smells amazing. 

I'm so relieved to have found these products that I want to cry. I'm finally on my way to the skin I've always wanted. The oil is very rich and concentrated, so don't be scared of the cost. It goes a long way. I have the mini, and I can tell that tiny bottle will last about 2 months.",,25-34,Combination,"Acne, Anti-aging, Dryness, Sensitivity, Dullness"

The day after I first used the Emerald Oil, my skin tone was so even and the pimples that were coming up had reduced in size and angriness.

Initially, it seemed to cause a little more dryness than usual which was absolutely not expected, but I think my skin was just getting used to the added oil (may have been compensating by under-producing natural oil). After about a week and a half, I can comfortably say that this stuff works like magic. My skin tone is 10x more even and I only have redness leftover on my cheeks.

I need something that will help combat the oily, acne-prone, middle aged skin I have. I am about as fair skinned as you can be, consistently the fairest shade in any kind of face makeup, so acne and healing acne marks show dramatically on my skin. This face cream has helped reduce my shine, evened out the redness of any unwanted blemishes in my complexion, as well as helping fade old healing marks! My skin is much more refined in texture. I love this product! Used in conjunction with an anti-aging serum, it has also helped diminish fine lines.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/aquarius-cream,5,2022-12-23,Great cream with lots of benefits and pretty matte finish! (See my comment about dead skin),"This is a great cream to use at night if you're trying to gently exfoliate. If your skin is already well exofilated, this can be a great day time product to maintain that while also giving you a well-hydrated matte finish before make up. Be aware that this product is an exfoliant, so if used when you have a lot of dead skin and dryness, it can cause your skin to lift off and pill. I noticed this was more intense when I used lapis facial oil afterwards. The two combined were great for exfoliation however, and make my skin look lovely. I just don't reccomend for daytime use/before makeup unless you are well exfoliated because of the dead skin. This product was hydrating, calming, evened my skin tone, helped remove dead skin, refined my pores, was a good base for makeup application, smelled nice, has nice coloring/packaging/presentation and was fun to use.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/aquarius-cream,5,2022-03-30,Wonderful product,"I'm not using it myself as it's not ""designed"" for my skin type specifically but I bought it for my daughter who has combo acne prone skin the poor thing, she's 14 and the acne took us all by surprise as no one in my family has dealt with that skin problem! I myself have desert dry skin with eczema and rosacea all problems that mostly began in my twenties but blemishes were never a problem in my teenage years, my skin was literally crystal clear, it's only been in my adult years that I've started experiencing problems with my skin so her getting acne was such a shock but that happening was actually the reason I got into skincare and eventually found this brand by accident really but I'm always happy I did as this is one of my favorite brands! I've tried probably all of the products (except for some of the newest ones, haven't gotten around to it YET) and I love them all! This cream has worked amazing for my daughters skin. She has very sensitive and reactive skin and fragrance is one of the ingredients that irritates it for example, it can't even be ""organic"" fragrance because it will burn and sting her skin so this cream having no scent is just what she needs. She's been using the Aquarius cream for a few months now and she seems to like it too (she's not into skincare and it is a hassle every day to get her to take care of her skin unfortunately) but this cream doesn't irritate her skin or burn it and so far it doesn't seem to cause more breakouts, in fact it seems more like she has less breakouts after she started using it! I was away for 3 months in another country and while I am away I know that she isn't following the skincare routine that I tell her to use, she just can't really be bothered with it as she just wants to be on her phone or computer playing video games but it is easy for her to just wash her face and use a cream (no serums, essences, masks etc that I want her to use as well) so I think she only used this cream while I was away and her skin looked so good when I got back! She barely had any blemishes at all! I've already purchased a new jar even though she hasn't finished the other one completely because I know that this is the cream I want her to continue to use. The texture is very creamy and bouncy and lightweight yet at the same time it's hydrating enough without being greasy! It's exactly what her skin needs, because it's combo she does have dry areas too so the cream serves all the issues it needs to without creating more problems like so many other products do. And the cute blue jar is just icing on the cake as it's very aesthetically pleasing, plus her dad's sign is Aquarius ;)

I have oily skin and have always had larger pores/sebaceous filaments on my nose, cheeks, and chin. This cream makes my face less oily during the day and reduces the size of my pores and also reduces my sebaceous filaments. Obviously both aren’t completely gone but it’s certainly an improvement.

My proof is that even in the most acne-prone part of my cycle, my skin is totally clear. Also, 2 weeks info using it regularly and I see a difference in the texture of my skin,the size of my pores.

I have combo skin - more on the oily side - and consistently had problems finding moisturizers that weren’t too greasy because by the end of the day or early morning, I would have to wipe my face down due to excess oil production!

What drew me into this product was its “soft matte finish”. Not only did I receive the product in 3 days, but it WORKS! I used it in the morning before work, and I couldn’t believe my eyes when I got home. My face was BARELY oily. I’m not even exaggerating. Of course I had oil production, but it was significantly waaaay less than what I usually have, especially on days where it’s super hot! This thing works. It’s not too heavy, has no scent (which is a plus), and has a beautiful sky blue color. 

The ONLY complaint I have about this product is the packaging. The box was gorgeous, the glass container it’s in is adorable, BUT the sticker for the name is what had me confused. All of their other products has engraved printing on the bottles, so when I saw that this was a sticker it just made it feel a little cheap (even though the product itself WORKS WONDERS). But that’s it. Everything else is an A+ in my book.

I've been using the lapis oil for years, and although its no magic bullet (I still get break outs/uneven skin texture), my skin is definitely better when I use it and worse when I don't. I was intrigued by aquarius because it uses some of the same ingredients as lapis, but I also felt like lapis was doing a decent enough job keeping me hydrated. Still, the black friday sale was too tempting to pass up. 

I like aquarius. I've tried using it instead of lapis, and I've tried mixing them together. Honestly, I can't say that my skin has noticeably improved, but it seems like a good way to get more mileage out of the (more pricy) lapis oil. A little cream goes a long way, and adding just one or two drops of lapis makes it easier to spread and easier to absorb. It's not a miracle worker, but it's a more cost effective way to get the same or better level of moisturizing as just using the oil.",,25-34,Combination,"Acne, Sensitivity, Dryness"

People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, and moon fruit). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that.

The bakuchiol serum is a godsend. I started using this in November and am just now getting to the bottom of my first bottle - it's the end of March. I use 3 drops every night. 

Like all retinol/retinol alternative products, it takes 8-12 weeks before you start seeing results. And let me tell you - I have! While pores don't actually shrink (fact, sorry), this product has significantly helped smooth my skin's texture and has helped clear congestion in my pores. I didn't experience any breakouts with this and my skin always feels so soft and refreshed in the morning (since I apply at night).

I just bought my second bottle - which is huge for me, because I'm always switching it up and trying to find skin care products that work better than what I've had before. But this stuff, man - this is the jackpot.",,25-34,Oily,"Acne, Dark spots, Dullness, Oiliness, Pores"

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/rose-hibiscus-face-mist,5,2019-07-21,"Awesome product, but I have a respiratory reaction too :*(","I have been using Rose Hibiscus for several years now and I love it. It didn't seem necessary to me for my very dry skin because I use Pink Cloud, Phoenix, and several other Herbivore oils that are all very moisturizing, but I love using it to cool down my skin after a shower and it's very refreshing in the morning too. I have found myself using it just because it feels really good! I recently tried it to set my makeup and it works great for that too! I was about to purchase it again when I read some of the reviews that people cough after spraying it on their faces, and I realized I do the same thing! I have noticed that I do, but I thought it was just because I was spraying a fine mist in my face and then breathing it in - it didn't occur to me that it might be an allergic issue. I have sensitive lungs - strong perfumes and fake chemical scents bother me, and I am sensitive to some herbal and natural products as well. Sadly I don't think I will repurchase this because of that. I do recommend others try it though because it's great. I love all of Herbivore's products that I have tried. They provide amazing results, and I love that they are completely natural and without chemicals!!",,,,

It feels light on one's face, moisturizes well, reduces and doesn't cause breakouts, and works great under makeup. It's not drying, nor does it make your face too wet. It has certainly helped me throughout my clear skin journey: it's helped me achieve clear skin (my skin type is generally oily and moderately acne-prone). This stuff is the dream. 

Overall, I highly recommend this product. It is also a good size, and one bottle can last a long time.",,,,

People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, moon fruit, prism face mask, brighten face mask, and tansy face mask). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that. I love cloud jelly and how it almost feels like little bubbles bursting as I press it into my skin. My skin always just feels so plump and soft after.

A little back story…I have been in the process of recovering from a chronic illness. I’ve never had skin issues before until I got sick. I experienced a lot of breakouts and I was left with these awful dry, white head-filled, red dotted patches on both of my cheeks. It was dreadful  to deal with and look at daily. I hated feeling the dry, flaky texture of my once smooth skin. 
 I tried everything under the sun. Nothing seemed to help. It was a fine line of needing hydration but not too much due to the white heads/breakouts. I read all the reviews on cloud jelly and was curious about the story of the woman who said it helped heal her daughters burned hands. So I decided to give it a try…..

After ONE week of use my whole family was complimenting me on my skin. My kids told me “mommy you look like the girl in your wedding pictures again”! The dry patches are GONE, white heads are GONE, redness GONE…my skin is the best it has been in YEARS!  My kids and husband are constantly stopping me saying how glowy and smooth my skin is! When I run my hand along my cheeks, where I used to feel scaly dry patches I now feel silky smooth skin. It feels like for the first time in a long time, my skin is finally fully hydrated.
I will forever use this product, please never stop making it! It is wonderful. If you’re on the fence, GET IT!",,35-44,Combination,"Acne, Dryness, Dullness, Anti-aging, Dark spots"

I started using herbivores version and noticed that it worked better than the previous brand. My skin looks plumper, brighter, and moisturized. Like way more then before this product. I’m serious.

As they healed, she struggled with keeping them moisturized. Nothing we tried lasted very long, the purple tint of the scarring never went away and the scaling from the dryness never left for long. No product we tried seemed to help. She was embarrassed by the condition of her hands and was always trying to hide them, even refusing to wear clothes without pockets. I saw the Cloud Jelly on display in Sephora around Christmas, and tried a little. It felt nice to me, so I had her rub some on her hands. She said it felt nice. We left the store and as we were leaving hours later, she said her hands felt a lot better and asked if we could go back and buy the Cloud Jelly before we left. It’s now months and several bottles later, the healing and change in her hands has been incredible.

I ordered a starter pack from another well known brand (don’t want to throw anyone under the bus) but felt the hydrating serum just... wasn’t lasting. It was getting rid of the problem for a moment, but by the time I woke up in the morning my skin was dull and dehydrated again.
ENTER THIS. It was my birthday and I decided to splurge a little bit, obviously Herbivore is on the pricier side but boy was it worth it. It doesn’t just hydrate for the moment (totally forgot to put it on this AM) but it actually feels like it’s making my skin better. 
The tackiness threw me at first, I was so disappointed. BUT it still apples smoothly and the sticky feeling doesn’t last. I also got the orchid oil which is suggested to pair and combined they make my skin feel amazing and my face smell like flowers.

Every type of foundation was looking terrible and I was pretty desperate. 
I used the cloud jelly serum two days in a row, morning and night, and after the two days I noticed a huge improvement.
It does leave a little bit of a sticky residue, if you pat your skin you can feel it but it doesn't feel heavy or like it would be sticky on the face.

I only need 3 drops for my whole face, whereas with other serums, I normally use 8 drops. This is definitely a holy grail for me.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/cloud-jelly-tremella-plumping-hydration-serum,2,2022-06-21,Unfortunately a miss for me,"I've been using this serum for a few weeks and I honestly cannot say it's doing anything for me. I've been a huge Herbivore fan for a couple of years now and what I've tried of their products, which is a bit, I've pretty much loved all of it, so I was very intrigued when I saw this serum and I was lucky enough to be able to get it in a FabFitFun sale for much less then full prize, which was awesome. I have VERY dry eczema and rosacea prone skin, my eczema and rosacea are thankfully mild but still annoying enough to where makeup application and whatnot can be a hassle on account of the dry skin so I need a lot of hydration in my skincare routine and thought this could be a nice addition. Well my take on it is that it doesn't give any hydration whatsoever! The consistency is extremely thin, almost like water with a little gel in it, VERY similar to their cloud cleanser, and it absorbs immediately, and not in a good way. I cannot feel any hydration on my skin after putting it on, if anything I feel more dry then before plus it doesn't seem to agree with the rosacea either as my skin starts flushing a bit after application. The vit c serum that I use (not Herbivore) leaves my face feeling more hydrated than this! :/ I'm sad to say this product isn't working out for me because of how much I like this brand and their products. Maybe this could be a good serum for those with combo/oily or even normal skin, it could possibly give them some hydration but those with dry to very dry skin aren't going to benefit any hydration (or anything for that matter) from it in my opinion. I will give it credit for not breaking me out though. I don't typically deal with blemishes but some products have broken me out and this serum did not do that, so that's something I guess.

People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, moon fruit, prism face mask, brighten face mask, and tansy face mask). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that. Prism is top 3 product for me — one that I will always keep in my regimen. It provides an amazing glow, and my skin just feels better with it.

There are many kinds of comedonal acne but that is what I have, and my skin texture is never smooth because of it and I am very oily. It was triggered by the humid climate and I’m just figuring that out all these years. I thought I had regular acne,but I don’t, and the face cleansing brush or scrubs or masks made the problem worse.

I’ve been using it for about a month now on my oily combination skin. I am so happy with the results. Acne scars are fading fast, and my skin is starting to look healthy and clear again. I’ve tried all 3 of the Herbivore fave oils and they are all great products. I shied away from the Phoenix oil because my skin is oily, but I had a horrible case of acne caused by another brands products and battled it with lots of drying acne meds. My skin became oily and dry at the same time, and I was left with scars. I took a look at the Phoenix oil ingredients and researched them and they were all safe for my sensitive oily skin. So I ordered a small bottle and I saw very quick results. I’ve since purchased the full size. Now that my skin isn’t dehydrated I still use this oil day and night. It’s not as light as the Orchid oil but it absorbs just as well into my skin. My skin is soft and clear and I’m a few weeks away from being able to ditch my concealer again. I really can’t say enough good things about the Phoenix oil. I also apply it to my lips and it leaves them super plump and moisturized too. Sometimes I mix it with the Orchid oil in the morning under my sunscreen when I need less moisture. This oil is very moisturizing, but not greasy. Don’t be afraid to try it if you have an oilier complexion like mine. Your skin might love it too!",,35-44,Oily,"Acne, Anti-aging, Dark spots, Oiliness, Pores, Sensitivity"

Needless to say, this is why my heart sank when I dropped my bottle today, that was still 3/4 full, and it shattered spilling all of the oil. It is completely my fault, but I even attempted to save some of the oil From the floor (I had just cleaned my floor that morning):rofl: I would attach photos, but there is no way to upload them for reviews.

I saw reviews on sephora saying how this product wrecked peoples faces and to stay away so i gave up. Then i saw one review saying to stick through it because of the purging phase. I had purging before but never this bad so at the moment i didn't think it was purging. 

I tried it again and decided to stick through it. I'm about a month in now and in the first two weeks I had a total of 10 huge red and pussy pimples pop up EVERYWHERE, it was the worst I've seen my skin. Keep in mind I haven't done any exfoliation in my life really. Then at 3 weeks no new pimples. Now all the swollen red ones are little tiny marks and my skin looks glowing, more even and the ramaining purge zits are tiny and half of them are gone. It looks like clear skin is finally in sight and i can honestly say my skin has never looked better and this is the longest i've gone with no new zits popping up. 

If you do purge, please do yourself a favor and stick with it!!! Especially if your poor skin has never been exfoliated much like mine.",,18-24,Oily,"Acne, Dullness, Oiliness, Sensitivity"

I sparingly used the bottle I had until I finally had to replace it. I am soooo glad I took the plunge and tried the new version! I always struggled with texture and small whiteheads before I started the old prism. It helped control some of that, but not like what this product does! My face is so much smoother and brighter! My makeup has gone on so smooth the morning after I used this. I don’t feel any tingling with application and it has kept my hormonal blemishes from surfacing.

The lapis and Phoenix oils are intensely hydrating and make my skin feel plush and soft, like that wonderful post shower effect. I have combination skin, and alternating these oils has been wonderful.
I use all three soaps. I use the exfoliating soap and Prism 1-2 times a week. I always follow up with the whipped cloud moistener- it is so light and easily absorbed. I cannot get enough of these products! I hope that one day Herbivore might create an eye cream!",,,,

I previously used brands like Clinique and Estee Lauder for skin care, but Herbivore has changed my life. I love that it is natural, cruelty-free, but most importantly, effective! I have been using the phoenix oil for over a month and have seen old discoloration or damage from acne disappear. I massage the oil in with my jade roller and follow up with my moon fruit mask.

People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, moon fruit, prism face mask, brighten face mask, and tansy face mask). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that.

I have uneven texture on either side of my nose below my under eye. This is the only product that has made a significant difference in evening my skin texture/dullness.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil,5,2018-05-31,Finally,"I'll start by saying I have tried a *lot* of facial oils--for fun to experiment but also to find that ""one"". I use oils for the reason Herbivore describes that most creams are full of fillers and water (which usually meant imbalance and oily/dry areas for my skin, and constant breakouts).

I have used many quality oils that I liked for different reasons but none had all the checkboxes I wanted--until this one. Look at the amazing benefits all packed into this oil!! Truly remarkable--and the price point is fair considering many oils I've tried charge more with less than half the active ingredients this has.

Now for the good part--even when slathering my face in other oils I'd use to combat my dry skin, nothing would really correct it. My skin seems to become very dehydrated and tired come night time so I really want to give it love at overnight. But I'd wake up with the same dry feeling. Sun spots, acne scarring, dullness...these were all things I struggled with.

But this oil truly turns the damage around--I'm having more renewed skin than I thought I could. The side of my face that had the scarring and texture is actually fading and improving in clarity. I wake up with soft, glowing skin.

And I'm not allergic, which I'm very used to with many oils. 

This brand is amazing. I will try out all the oils/toners, and even the moon fruit treatment soon.",,,,

I even use it on my 12 year old daughter because she has acne on her forehead.

I have never felt so moisturized and my acne scars from previous cysts that had stubbornly stayed for months have only started to fade since adding this to my routine. I'm tempted to try rubbing it all over my eczema/psoriasis spots on the rest of my body haha. My dry, flakey skin smooths out after applying this in the AM/PM, but after only two weeks my small bottle of phoenix oil is almost gone and I certainly cannot afford more since it is prohibitively expensive.

Then I let it take its time to soak in and reap the rewards! It delivers on the moisture and for me at least had two unexpected benefits: longer eyelashes and softened scars. Highly recommended! 

For those curious, I typically use either Thayer's Witch Hazel toner or Herbivore Rose Hibiscus Mist first, let that dry, then massage in Herbivore Jasmine Body Oil or plain grapeseed oil in a pinch, before applying Phoenix oil.",,,,

1. I've been using retinol + hydroquinone products off and on for the last two years to help clear my stubborn melasma. The byproduct of those strong products is dry patches and subsequent battle with oily skin and clogged pores where I try to apply extra moisture. 
2. With extra stress over the last few months, my skin has broken out occasionally with some ugly acne, and I wanted to clear the acne, minimize scarring, and help clear my pores.
So far, I think it is improving the texture of my skin and is helping my other products to penetrate my skin better. The pores on the apples of my cheeks are minimizing. I'm excited to see how it helps my skin with consistent use in the months to come.

It took me a while to get it due to covid but I was eager to try it. Once it arrived I went right to the bathroom and got to work. The substance in the jar wasn't as gel like to me as what the pictures had shown it did apply well to my face though. I do have semi sensitive skin so I decided to do the full 20 minutes. I now know I need to only do the 5 to 10 min mark. If left too long on the skin it does cause redness so I recommend to start with just 5 to 10 minutes first. After wiping off the mask, I used the sample bottle of LAPIS which made my skin so smooth and reduced redness. After using PRISM and LAPIS HERBIVORE has a life long customer now. I just went and bought a large bottle of the LAPIS and some other products to try out.

I have the kind of sensitive skin that is red and reactive, and as a result, it overproduces oil.  I've never had much luck with traditional 'balancing ' moisturizers for combination skin, and sensitive skin moisturizers are often too heavy.  This cream balances my skin while softening it too.  One of the first things I noticed was how it immediately calmed my skin upon application- and my skin just soaked it up.  And it went to work healing it right away.  I tried this because it had been gifted to me, and I'd run out of my regular moisturizer.  I'm so glad I did, because now I cannot live without it.  The texture is divine, and a little goes a long way.  I use this with the matching serum at night.  My skin is balanced, and has less redness.  I haven't had to use as much makeup since I've been using this cream either.  I'm on my 5th or 6th jar- it's the cream I can't live without.

I use a tiny bit of this moisturizer on my chin & cheeks, and in between my eyebrows and I’ve had no issues with burning or oil. I’ve seen some reviews about this causing a breakout, or pilling, and honestly I’ve had neither experience, and recommend seriously just using a little tiny bit right in the areas you need extra moisture.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2022-01-14,It actually really works better than most products I've tried!,"I'm in my mid 30s with combination skin prone to all the different kinds of acne - whiteheads, blackheads, cystic, hormonal, eczema, etc. I've been breaking out since I was 10. My mother had acne. My brother has severe acne. I tried every over the counter product sold for the past 20+ yrs, been to dozens of dermatologist appointments (that made my skin the worst, ironically), tried many prescriptions. Nothing ever worked, most products make my skin worse. 

A few months ago I stumbled upon this. I bought it on a whim along with a dozen other new products.  Out of everything new I bought/tried, and out of everything I tried in years past, this stuff works the best. The scent is lovely. It hydrates your skin without feeling greasy or shiny. I even tried a similar blue tansy serum from a different company and it did nothing compared to this Lapis serum (I think the other company diluted their serum too much). My whiteheads/blackheads have reduced by over 60% in just under 2 months. Cystic and hormonal acne is almost nonexistent, and the breakouts I do have heal completely in just a few days instead of the weeks/months they took to heal before. Pores/scars are greatly diminished. My skin looks the best it has in years. Inflammation from clogged pores shrinks down to almost nothing. It somehow hydrates my dry cheeks without greasing up my T zone. I feel like my skin would be happy just using this alone, though I do layer it with other products. I use benzoyl peroxide once every 2-3 days first, or a ""buffer"" serum with hylauronic acid and peptides. Then I use Lapis - about 5-6 drops on my face and 2-3 on my neck and chest. Then I use a moisturizer (on dry days) or sunscreen. Then I top it off with a few drops of either one of a couple of ""barrier building""-type pore minimizing/anti inflammatory serums/moisturizers I've been experimenting with, though I keep noticing that THIS serum is the key each day. The others products I use don't have as immediate and drastic results. My skin never looked so good without makeup. My skin tone seems even and healthy, not patchy and blotchy like before. I immediately bought a 2nd bottle after a week of using this, and now it's almost 2 months and I've used 1/10th of the first bottle. It's pricy. but VERY worth it. A little goes a long way and it lasts a long time. Highly recommend.",,35-44,Combination,"Acne, Anti-aging, Dark spots, Dullness, Oiliness"

I NAILED it, this is fan-freakin- tastic. I didn't know i needed help w acne as it was so minimal I (again) assumed it was from my mask. But no. . . So anyway, that's all fixed up.

It glides on very smoothly and doesn't create any stickiness which would cause the skin to snag or tug when applying it. It sinks in nicely and wears very well under makeup.

I use the cloud jelly cleanser, prism serum, cloud jelly serum, and pheonix face oil. My husband uses the nova serum and lapis face oil as well and both of our skin has improved so much since we found herbivore. Unfortunately this moisturizer doesn’t even deserve to be on your website. When I opened it the first thing I did was smell it because all of your other products have lovely scents but all I could smell was a slight chemical smell. As soon as I started to rub it into my skin it started to burn. I have only used it once so I hope it doesn’t give me a bad reaction. I will be sticking to my favorite moisturizer siren silk, I just thought it would be worth a try. I also noticed that all the five star reviews are old so maybe the formula has decreased in quality over time?",,18-24,Normal,

Despite the rich consistency, it melts into the skin and feels lightweight upon application.  It does a great job of firming the skin while also being extremely hydrating.  Once it soaks in, my under eye area looks smoother, which makes it a great base for concealer.  Since I've started using this eye cream, I've noticed my concealer isn't creasing as frequently.

After months of obsessing over the brand, I finally decided to take a chance on the Orchid Facial Oil mini. After a couple months of using this oil, I've become a fan for life. After only a few days, I noticed a difference in the wrinkles near my eyebrows- the creases have nearly disappeared. My skintone is much more even where I previously had dark patches and acne scars.

I have tricky skin. I get small zits and clogged pores, but nothing cystic. The zits turn to little scabs that seem to never heal. It can take over a month sometimes, and I hate it. Unfortunately my skin is also extremely dry, but whenever I try to add moisture I break out more. I don't even want to think about how much money I've spent over the years buying products that haven't worked. Lately the flaky skin has been awful on my nose due to wearing masks. I have raw patches on my nose that seem to never heal, just continually flake.

I started using one drop each of the Phoenix, Emerald, and Lapis oils after my moisturizer at night. In the morning I do the same thing, but before my moisturizer because that one has SPF and I don't want to rub it away.

My skin has changed DRAMATICALLY in only 3 days! Zero new zits, my skin absolutely glows, and my scabs/raw patches have already healed so much! I'm 31 and starting to get some fine lines on my forehead, and they're already less noticeable. I think it's because of how well this oil is hydrating and plumping my skin.

Lapis is a holy grail product for me. Smells incredible, and clears my acne while hydrating my skin at the same time.

I'm so relieved to have found these products that I want to cry. I'm finally on my way to the skin I've always wanted. The oil is very rich and concentrated, so don't be scared of the cost.

My daughter had been injured on her face and I researched oils rather intensively to find the best one to help her heal both faster, and to prevent it from becoming a scar.  This led me to the blue tansy oil, and over time, as she healed, with hardly a sign of her injury in a most miraculous way, the side effect was her complexion became clearer as well.  I ended up putting both my husband and myself on the oil as well, and this stuff just works!!! The sandalwood in conjunction with it, is like the dynamic duo that calms redness that can appear as rosacea or just flat out high color in those who exhibit high emotion, like myself, because I have kids and life and stress happens to affect my skin color ;)  (think Princess Diana who had to have green makeup on her wedding day to cover her redness from high emotion).  At any rate, this works best used in very small amounts after first spritzing with a mist/toner of preferred type and then lightly patted in everywhere.

It greatly reduces breakouts and redness and hydrates my skin without it feeling greasy.  I use it twice a day and mix a few drops in with my oil free facial lotion and it works wonders.  It goes on nicely under makeup and helps the makeup not settle as much into fine line or dry out later on.  I wish they made a lapis toner or facial spray as this would be great.

I LOVE this newer packaging because the previous roller application was kind of annoying. So thank you Herbivore Babes!!!!! -Now- this stuff is amazing *_* I use it only after cleansing every day, morning and night; I dont cleanse at night religiously, though. I’ve noticed a major difference in my skin and consistency with this product. I used to suffer from bad hormonal acne on my chin and jawline and forehead bumps that weren’t pimples just weird bumps. Even when I wasn’t using toner or masks or even a regular moisturizer in my routine, orchid oil kept my skin clear, glowing and happy. The smell is beautiful as well, I never get sick of it and you don’t notice it after it’s all absorbed in and you go on with your day. A few drops like 5-6 is perfect for me. It doesn’t sit on your face all greasy. It leaves it soo soft but dewy. I usually go through 1 of these of a month, at times faster.

I loved it so much I decided to try the Orchid oil. I love this one too!!! I apply the Orchid oil under my eyes and on my lips and decolate where and the Lapis oil everywhere else. Or I use the Orchid oil all over at night when my skin is calm and not inflamed or irritated. This stuff smells divine too!! It’s also great for the ends of my hair.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil,5,2018-01-15,So happy with this brand,"I bought Orchid oil as a Christmas gift for my mom. I had smelled the oil before and felt the texture, both which were absolutely stunning, so I thought this might be the right one for her. She's not really an oil person but she told me she really loves Orchid and would possibly even buy another when her's is done! I was so delighted at this. Orchid is light enough to wear during the day as it's not greasy or heavy. The jasmine scent is intoxicating, which is plus!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil,5,2017-12-09,Far exceeds oils/creams 4x its price it's perfect!,"I'm 24 and had never washed my skin before trying Herbivore just under a year ago; I've since experimented with a few other clean brands for fun – all of which were far more expensive – but none felt nearly as luxurious as Herbivore's products. They all made my pours too large or irritated my skin, which is otherwise clear (hence why I'd never used products on my face)

The Orchid oil is absolutely among my favorite products (along with the brightening, clay, and tansy masks as well as the coco rose body polish). The smell is calming and when I apply it at night both my skin and my mind wake up feeling clean and calm .

My only request is to be able to order the orchid roller on its own (honestly, I would probably order one to keep in my bathroom, one for my purse, and one for my gym bag or car), but the roller only comes in a trial set (the trial set was my first purchase – highly recommend!) or oil set. This mini is packaged with a dropper like the larger oils, which is nice in its own right. But the roller is perfect on the go as it offers a bit more control than the dropper.

This is the first review I've ever written and can't rave enough about herbivore's products, but I hope they'll make individual rollers available for purchase!",,,,

Turns out it's the best product I've added to my regimen in years -- instant glow and softness, none of the oil-slick residue I've found with other high-priced skin oils. It's perfect, and I know the ingredients are pure, so it's officially my new favourite product! I use it before bed and in the am under sunscreen. Will definitely buy the full size once I run out!",,,,

It layers well over vitamin c and under sunscreen and makeup, never irritates my skin.  I think it helps to reduce break-outs, makes my skin softer and more even-toned (I'm prone to redness/rosacea), and also has a lovely smell.

I have tried both cheaper and more expensive vitamin C products such as The Ordinary's Vitamin C Suspension and Dr Dennis Gross Vitamin C Serum and have found that Nova provides the results I am looking for. As the vitamin C concentrations are higher and are not offered as a complex I feel confident that my skin is getting the protection that I am looking for and I have found that my acne has also decreased since using the product. My skin is looking brighter and I love the way that it feels. I have also noticed that my fine lines are not as noticeable. I don't find this product to be sticky and it does have a touch of turmeric smell when applied that becomes unnoticeable after a few minutes.

I have tried numerous other facial oils & Herbivore is very different. These oils sink in to your skin quickly, don't just sit on top. They are not greasy at all so you can actually wear them under make-up. Very moisturizing & brightening, but doesn't clog pores.
I work 12+ hour shifts & my make-up often ""dries out"" or wears off by the end of the day. I find my make-up looks much fresher for much longer, and also lasts longer when using Orchid in the morning. And of course it smells amazing!",,,,

How amazing it smells (very strongly of jasmine) made me want to rub it all over my body, so I got the jasmine body oil, too. I love Orchid and I will absolutely be repurchasing when I run out!

I was crazy skeptical about using any kind of oil on my face since I have oily skin. I thought it was just going to make it worse, but turns out it stops my skin from overproducing oil since I'm replenishing it with the oil in the morning and night. I use three pumps during the day and simply use a mattifying powder to get rid of the glow. But if you have super dry skin, you won't need to use powder. I also use about ten pumps at night to spoil myself before bed. It feels so incredibly luxurious.

It smells amazing and makes my skin look younger and feel so healthy. It gives me a glow when I wear it under my makeup. I'm a huge fan. Not sure how I lived without it for so long.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil,5,2016-07-05,INCREDIBLE.,"This oil is incredible.

For years, I have tried to get on the facial oil trend, but never really found one that I liked. I had bought a few other products from Herbivore before and really loved them, and wanted to give this oil a try.

About my skin: acne prone (the ugly, under the skin cystic type), relatively sensitive, very fair, combination in terms of oiliness. I have dry patches as well as some discoloration because of old acne, and sun spots.

I only bought the travel-sized roll on of the Orchid oil, and I wish I had bought the full size. This stuff is so nice - it smells AMAZING, and I have been using it both during the day and at night. It's replaced my day time moisturizer, and it absorbs beautifully. I layer my sunscreen over it and everything sits very well, and my makeup applies flawlessly. I've never felt greasy or oily, and nothing slides around. My skin looks clear, hydrated, and happy - I have definitely noticed a difference, especially in the morning when I wake up. 

I am absolutely in love with this product and will definitely be purchasing the full sized bottle. While it is pricey, I believe it is worth every penny!

Thank you, Herbivore, for making natural, luxurious products that make my skin beautiful, that smell lovely, and that work!",,,,

I started using the Orchid oil and noticed results within days! The spot is significantly fading and its dry patch seems to be getting smaller and smaller. I then began using the oil all over my face in place of moisturizer and it gives my skin a beautiful matte texture and subtle glow! I will definitely be purchasing a full size in the future :)",,,,

People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, moon fruit, prism face mask, brighten face mask, and tansy face mask). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that.

I feel in love with both products and used them off and on for a couple years. I never purchased a large bottle, just the small sizes. I would run out and switch to another brand and started to notice a pattern. My skin was glowing and acne gone when I used the lapis oil. I started having some cystic acne this spring and thought it was diet, or hormones or dehydration. I was trying everything with no help. My chin and jawline was so congested. It dawned on me to purchase a big bottle of Lapis oil and give that a try before my next option of seeing a dermatologist. You guys!!! Within 4 days of using the Lapis oil again my sling completely cleared! My skin is glowing and all the congestion is gone! I did you the blue tansy mask once as well, but I think the winner is the LAPIS OIL!!! I won’t go without it ever again!",,35-44,Combination,"Acne, Dullness"

I had never fathomed putting (even more!) oil on my face, but this product had a great reputation and NATURAL ingredients so I decided to splurge (along with the Pink Cloud cleanser) and hope for the best. I was so happy to see this product didn’t have pore-clogging polymers and silicones like most oil-free moisturizers do. Upon application, this lightweight oil had a pleasant scent and absorbed quickly and fully. Within DAYS of nightly use, I saw a huge improvement in the amount of inflammation and redness of my acne.

What I can say is that this product has incredible texture and thickness, disappears under my eyes without issue, can be worn under makeup without smudging, and has no overpowering scent.

For years I've suffered from large pores, hormonal acne, combination skin, and just general unevenness of skintone/texture on my face. I saw this in an ad and bought the sample bottle to try. I've applied three drops (forehead and each cheek) morning and evening for the last month and a half or so, and let me just say, nothing - not even prescription cleansers/creams - has ever come close to what Lapis has done for me. Within a week, my skintone and texture had evened to the point where I stopped wearing foundation. My skin is smooth, pores are less visible, and the color is even and has a certain healthy glow to it that it's never had before. Since I've started using it, I have had zero acne. None. Not a single pimple, hormonal or otherwise. Oiliness has improved. It may be a bit drying in a couple areas, but it's not bad at all. Overall, I am extremely impressed (and boggled) by this stuff.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2022-02-07,This is a game changer!,"As a heads up, I am not one of those fake paid reviews I just want to rave about this product lol. I am someone who gets acne from any skincare product regardless of formulation. Anti-acne, sensitive, etc... will absolutely give me acne and I had basically given up looking at skincare because I was so tired of having acne and everything just made it so much worse. When I saw this product I was very interested in trying it but the price tag made me stall for a bit because in my mind why would I pay that much to give myself more acne. Finally breaking down considering the incredible reviews this product has gotten, I splurged on the big bottle. I could have bought the mini or the smaller bottle to try the product without spending so much, but on the chance that this product worked I wanted the full size and WOW, am I glad I bought the big  bottle! Within the first week I was in love with this oil. I was in the shower noticing that all the small milia bumps and clogged pores trapped under the skin were completely gone, just GONE! The second week I noticed that the light rosacea I have was also diminished by I'd say 95% and my pores and the spaces between the pores looked so much better than they ever have in my entire life I wanted to cry actual tears of joy because I feel so good about my skin now. This oil is so light and airy, it completely sinks into my skin within minutes and does not leave me feeling even a little bit greasy. Some people complained about the 'medicinal' smell, but once it's dry I don't smell it at all and it's just camphor in the blue tansy that you're smelling so it's not an unnatural fragrance. Knock on wood, in the three weeks of once daily use(the bottle says do it twice, but I only do it once before bed after toning with witch hazel) of this oil I have not gotten a single pimple. If I noticed a bump, it was not red and it disappeared within a day. I am looking in a mirror now which is what encouraged me to make this review because I can't believe the difference this product made on my skin. If you have doubts if this product will work for you, try it anyways. I am so glad I tried this, it has literally changed my life and skin in such a quick time frame I'm still shocked it can even be real.

Herbivore, thank you! This incredible oil is the ONLY product in my 32 years to improve my skin and not make it worse.

It is ridiculously tiny for the price. And while it may be the .5 oz advertised (which is also ridiculous for the price) it appears to only be half full in the jar, which sorta adds insult to injury. You really want a full jar, especially when the jar itself is miniscule.
As for the product itself, a little does go a long way. You don't really need more than a dab since it just goes under the eyes. That's a huge relief. Lol. It goes on smooth. Feels nice and doesn't have much of a smell. I can't attest to wear ability with makeup as I don't wear any, but it doesn't feel greasy or anything. I haven't noted the 10 minute results, but I also don't have wrinkles or deep bags under the eyes either.

The smell is terrible - it literally smells like a sharpie. I wish it smelled better because it does a great job of hydrating and made my skin soft. Like baby butt soft.

I guess a lot of people like the smell of this though, so maybe it's just me? Or maybe I received a bad batch scent wise. On the the bright side the scent faded away after it soaked in.

I definitely do not have sensitive skin, so I layered this oil atop my A313 balm without testing it first. The first 30 minutes were fine and I was enjoying the slightly thicker texture of this oil compared to the Lapis. By the time I went to bed, I was noticing some light tingling near my under-eyes but it wasn’t uncomfortable. I awoke an hour later with my face absolutly on fire with burning and itching! Luckily there was no visible rash on my skin, so I washed my face and applied an anti-itch gel. I can’t imagine what could have caused such a reaction apart from perhaps an allergy to orchid? I googled similar reactions and saw nothing, so maybe it was just a weird genetic disposition to orchid. Proceed with caution using this one, and test a small area first!",,,,

The next morning, skin seemed good, I put on for am. Maybe that second application was my mistake. The next mistake was going outside in the sun with a wide brimmed hat for two hours in the morning. Later that evening my face began to feel like sandpaper. I washed my face, applied some aloe leaf because it seemed the gentlest thing. The next morning my face and neck were covered in sandpaper bumps! And a little swollen. Much like a retinol purge when you start too fast or go in the sun. Miserably itchy and hot and also I look awful of course. The next morning my eyes were starting to swell (did not apply near eyes). This will take weeks to disappear and has ruined my plans for the week, buts it’s also just miserably uncomfortable. I had a retinol purge twice in my life but never ever like this.

I saw immediate results after the first week. Idk if the peel is too hard on my skin but I do notice okay results with that as well after a week or so. Between the tansy mask, the peel and the murad product, my acne and acne scars are almost all of the way gone. Redness and size of area has been reduced by atleast 70 percent. Also, the murad aha/abh cleanser is a life saver. I tend to build up dead skin relatively quickly (thank you psoriasis) and by interchanging these products, I've had some amazing results.

I hesitated but bought it. I’ve not been super militant about my routine and using it. But I’m halfway through my bottle and my fine lines have nearly disappeared and my skin is clear and less dry. While dryness is still a problem, it’s not as big of a problem.

I have been using this oil since 1,5 week and my skin has never looked better. I have spent sooo much money on skincare products - 2 years ago I had POD and last year I was suffering from Acne Rosacea. My skin was flaky and red during the last months and I was already desperate finding the right product. I like face oils very much and I thought to give this one a try. I admit it is a bit expensive and hard to find in Europe but it is definitely worth it. My skin has calmed down... I am barely red anymore and my skin looks even and is really glowing. I avoided looking into the mirror because my skin conditions were frustrating but now I just can't stop looking into the mirrow, as my skin looks great. Furthermore I wanted to add that I haven't been using any foundation since days because I don't need it :)

I really believe in the ingredients and love my new ritual each night, rubbing this in and using my jade roller after.

My complexion has never looked better......possibly as a toddler. : ) The cannabinoid oil treats and heals such a wide range of illnesses, migraines, stops or lessens seizures, can also heal pets and the list goes on and on. The realization that ingesting CBD oil sublingually to treat illness and inflammation should have been an epiphany for skin care companies. I know where to purchase the CBD oil described in my first sentence. Combine that with an Ayurvedic facial oil and voila! I can’t believe any of you didn’t discern this long ago?? You pay a company to include “maybe” 2%, 10% if they are feeling generous, in a facial oil you can easily make yourself? An Ayurvedic oil has dozens of beautiful essential oils, certainly more in comparison to this product. Silly women. Use the brain God gave you.",,,,

I live in northern Alaska, so to say my skin gets dry is an understatement. I've been (more or less) mixing pink cloud with emerald immediately following, and that combo has seriously been putting in some work on replenishing my moisture barrier. I had very high hope with this oil, knowing the benefits the plant itself has. This has lived up to and exceeded any expectations. It is very gentle and not too heavy. The scent is earthy, subtle and pleasing. My favorite part is what Emerald does for my inflamed and irritated cystic hormonal acne. Up until this point, I hadn't been able to find a product that can calm my skin so quickly and efficiently. I'm eager & anxious to see what this does for my skin in the long run! I will be posting an updated review in a month or two.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/emerald-deep-moisture-glow-oil,5,2019-01-04,Why did I wait this long?!,"I've been eyeing Herbivore for a couple years now but was really nervous about a face oil since I get occasional breakouts. I have the worst combination skin imaginable -- oil slicks in some spots and dry, flakiness in others. I didn't want to make the oily areas any worse but could never find something that could keep the dry areas hydrated and soft.

I have used the Emerald oil three times. Just three times, and my skin is completely different. The tone is brighter and more even, a couple blemishes disappeared overnight, and the dry skin is completely gone. Even better, those oily areas seem balanced out because they're even with the rest of my face and I'm not getting shiny by 4pm anymore. Plus my skin feels softer than it's ever been, even after products claiming to exfoliate and moisturize at the same time.

I've always only covered up my problem areas with concealer and now I feel no need. The balanced tone and subtle glow this gives me is borderline miraculous. I finally feel like one of those people that just wake up with amazing skin. (I use 4-6 drops in the morning and evening, and it's clear this bottle is going to last a long, long time so the price seems fair to me.) I'm only disappointed in myself for waiting so long to finally try it.",,,,

Thank you for creating a reliable and effective skin care brand! My skin has never looked better.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/emerald-deep-moisture-glow-oil,5,2018-12-17,OMG!... PERIOD!,"When I recieved the email to pre-order "" Emerald "" and read what the contents were I figured the price point was not at all bad so I ordered it. When I finally recieved my little bottle I looked at it and thought wow a green oil, cool. 
I started using it but honestly not on a regulare basis only because I have other oils that I use as well. But in order to see if this one was going to work out for me I figured let me use it the way it was meant to be used. So I started using it everyday.
Three weeks into using it everyday twice a day morning & night I was getting ready putting on my makeup I look into the mirror and OMG!
Allow me to explain. 
About 3 three years ago I noticed a small mole like thing growing on the side of my nose it grew a bit but never got real huge or anything. It was however bothering me that it was just there when I've never had anything on my face not even acne. I really wasn't very concerned about it because it was not growing after it reached it's peak I guess I would say. The color was skin color not dark or in any kind of irregular shape. 
In comes the EMERALD , as I mentioned earlier one day I was putting on my makeup and I almost had a heart attack! The thing on the side of my nose was going away!! That was a week ago today that I noticed it going away. Today 12/17 IT'S GONE! I know it's the oil because it's the only new step I've added to my skin care regimen. Thank You Herbivore! Btw I love the scent & everything about it!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/emerald-deep-moisture-glow-oil,5,2018-12-07,Absolute love at first drop,"Full disclosure: I love all things Herbivore. Though some products may not end up with a permanent spot on my shelf because they don’t work well for my skin type, there are many, many who have earned their spot. 
I have sensitive skin, which easily dries out and in the winter becomes flaky. I had been using Lapis oil at night (thanks adult acne), and Pink Cloud during the day, as well as cleansing with the Herbivore bar soaps. This was perfect for my skin, it was the most flawless it’s ever been. Then I moved to a much colder climate just in time for winter to roll in. My face became so dry I resorted to skipping wearing any makeup to avoid adding attention to the dryness. Lucky for me, Emerald was released just in time to save my skin.
Just a few added drops with my normal routine and my face immediately did a 180 and became hydrated, glowy, and supple. No more flakes, no more irritation around my nostrils and mouth. I can wear makeup now and it looks completely natural. Seriously, I can’t sing high enough praises.
I saw some reviews about the scent, people discrediting the product because of it. Honestly, I don’t understand the problem. It has a very light natural smell. Something a little herbaceous but nothing that is left on your skin for you to inhale all day. I apply the oil, I smell a faint hint of this wonderful scent, and then never give it a second thought. 
Bottom line, if you have dry skin problems, you have to try it. It is natural magic in a bottle.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/emerald-deep-moisture-glow-oil,5,2018-12-06,Amazing,"I converted to Herbivore skin regimen a few months ago. I love all their products but I needed something more hydrating for my skin. I was very excited to try this Green Oil. 
The results are amazing. 
I have to say, I still have hormonal breakouts, my skin is not perfect, but since I started using Herbivore products, it has definitely changed. I'm glowing and everybody notices it.
There are no miracle products, but trust me, Herbivore will make you feel glowing, beautiful with healthy skin!

This product makes my skin look so smooth and pearly-iridescent with practically no irritation whatsoever, even with daily use. The same cannot be said for any of the previously mentioned products.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/emerald-deep-moisture-glow-oil,5,2018-12-01,Best addition to the herbivore family,"I've discovered herbivore about two years ago and I've been in love ever since. The pink clay mask and the lapis oil are a staple in my daily routine. I'm in my 20s with very oily skin and hormonal cystic acne around my chin that I started developing when turned 22. I've never really had bad acne until adulthood (yay) just small bumps and a texture problem. The other herbivore products helped with my small bumps but not so much when that time of the month came around. The emerald glow oil completely changed that! I've been using it daily morning and night since it was first released earlier this month and I've been glowing ever since! My skin texture has improved and my hormonal acne was no match for the glow oil, only a couple of very small zits popped up that disappeared in two days. It's a very lightweight oil so it doesn't make you feel like a greaseball if you're an oily person like me. If you're thinking about getting it, do it, you won't regret it.",,,,

After the first night of using it, my face felt completely hydrated and supple again. By the second day, all the minor breakouts I had all disappeared?! I also really like the subtle scent it has.

I have oily/combo skin. I am in my late 30’s and only use Herbivore for ALL my face products. I have tried some very expensive products, Tatcha, Creme etc. and have spend a lot finding the “right” products. Finally after years and a lot of money this is my “home”:) I love my routine. I use the charecoal face bar to cleanse, green toner, Prism + Emerald and just added cloud moisturizer and will add a few drops of lapis or orchid depending on my skin and the weather. Not even sure of this is the right routine, but love the condition of my skin. I used to get menstral acne and it has minimized drastically.

I have very sensitive skin, and for the longest time Emerald was the only solution for me to moisturize my face. I am now thrilled to have this duo in my daily routine.

My skin felt brand new - it was tighter (but not dry), smoother, glowy like glass skin. This also makes some of the redness on my skin go away. Some people complain about the smell, but personally I love it - it smells invigorating. The small jar (from the duo which included the lapis oil) lasted me a long time because you really don't need a lot to cover your entire face. I just wish they would come in smaller jars and be sold individually because it's feels like a lot of money to drop on the big jar - and the color change overtime can turn you off from using it.

I have very sensitive skin and cannot handle most acid masks and cannot tolerate glycol even in small amounts. This has enough friendly acids to work(I do peel after using!) while being gentle enough to not cause burning or redness or irritation afterwards. For anyone that has sensitive skin, try this. I use it 2-3x a week. It is enough to keep some congestion and flakes at bay but not so strong that it will irritate or prevent all acne. IT is a perfect happy in-between for me.",,,,

It took them really long to disapear and as soon I got rid of one another one popped up. That was really frustrating, as I never had this before. I had an antibiotic cream but this didn't really help. So I started applying the blue tansy mask only on the acne/pimples on a daily basis....and I couldn't believe how amazing this was. Even after the first application my pimples got smaller, didn't hurt anymore. After 3 days of use it was almost gone and there are no new ones. Love love love this product.",,,,

After two weeks of use I have stopped using foundation. I just don't need it anymore. My skin feels and looks so good I don't want to cover it up!

Not only is this an organic and natural product that is an alternative to retinol but it actually works! I have very sensitive skin with mild rosacea and eczema so not a lot of products I can actually handle without getting some reaction but this one is just amazing!

I also have difficult, high maintenance skin, which makes keeping the product count low very unlikely as I'm constantly trying new things to calm, hydrate, & clear my skin. I've never considered using a toner before. I just thought it was an unnecessary step, but this toner has completely changed my standpoint & skin. Not only does it smell like a dream, but I've noticed a huge change in my skin.

I also noticed that it clears some of the occasional redness I get around my cheeks and under my nose.

Earlier this year, I began to notice fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I did my research and realized that retinol would be too rough (using the wrong eyeliner gives me blisters) and I needed bakuchiol. I went to my local Sephora and this was the only product that didn’t contain caffeine. 

I hesitated but bought it. I’ve not been super militant about my routine and using it. But I’m halfway through my bottle and my fine lines have nearly disappeared and my skin is clear and less dry. While dryness is still a problem, it’s not as big of a problem. 

I will probably be using this for the rest of my life. Absolutely recommend for anyone with super sensitive skin.",,25-34,Dry,"Anti-aging, Dryness, Sensitivity, Pores, Dullness"

The combination of using Bakuchiol and Prism daily was my holy grail for my extremely sensitive, combination skin. I had clear, glowing skin and my fine lines/wrinkles were diminished as well.When Bakuchiol was out of stock these past several months, I decided to try the Orchid facial oil.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/rose-hibiscus-face-mist,5,2016-02-26,A must have!,"For the past year or so I have been seeking a facial mist to spray before bed to rehydrate my skin. There are many facial mists out there but most of the ones that were coming up for me for makeup setting sprays. I for one think skin care quality comes first in order to have flawless skin with or without makeup! I didn't want to buy a facial mist that worked as a makeup setting spray as well. Make up, and skin care are two completely different departments. 

After weeks of research, I came across this spray and Herbivore Botanicals. At that time (sometime last year) I had never heard about Herbivore Botanicals :( Like many people I seek reviews reviews reviews! This spray had about 2 or 3 at the time that I was looking at it. I started to read about Herbivore and really got excited about the purity of their products. Regardless of the minimal reviews, I knew I had to try this spray out. Ordering was very simple, I received my package of the spray and lapis facial mask within I believe 2 weeks. 

This spray is beyond my expectations. The smell is wonderful, you feel like your walking through a rose garden! I spray it every night before bed and let it soak into my skin. I also do it after I use my lapis mask. 

I am very pleased with the facial spray and lapis mask that I ordered the lapis facial oil and roller!",,,,

I use it on my face and neck before putting on my makeup but I also spritz some in my hair while letting it air dry- it makes my hair soft and shiny and gives it more natural volume than if I use a mousse or hairspray- and it smells amazing! Just wanted to throw out there that this works as a softening and volumizing spray for hair as well as a great skin spray!",,,,

Herbivore's Rose Hibiscus Mist has proven me completely wrong--it IS a necessity, if you like hydrated skin and a calming moment whenever you can grab one. It even makes plane travel more pleasant and I was a frequent mister on my recent cross country flight. Love this stuff!",,,,

I use it throughout the day and after a cleanse my face as an excellent toner. It hasn't made me breakout either - which is what I'm always worried about when trying a new product (I think that's because there's only natural and organic ingredients in here). I highly recommend this,,,,

I've been using the Lapis oil and Blue Tansy mask for years and will never be without them, and have experimented with the Emerald CBD oil and now the Prism potion. I love all of Herbivore's products but this prism mask is really next level. That teeny sample has lasted me for quite a while, now (with once-weekly use) and the results I'm noticing are really amazing. I honestly didn't think my skin could look like this without prescription acids. I'm sure it's a combination of things, with Lapis and other products factoring in, but I notice an immediate difference with this mask and an even bigger difference the next day – texture is smoother, breakouts toned down, and my skin just looks fresh and bright. I will definitely be ordering the full size! Thanks, Herbivore, for another fantastic product!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/prism-20-aha-exfoliating-glow-facial-treatment,5,2020-01-14,Impressive Immediate Results,"This mask is remarkable! The results are noticeable immediately. This is the addition my skin regimen needs. My skin is nice and I take good care of it. But it can become dull despite my best efforts. The more I age, the longer it takes for cell turnover. Enter Prism 20%. My pores appear tighter and there is an obvious buoyancy and suppleness after use. I am fair with freckles and my skin easily shows imperfections like a thin white pant suit! This helps even out my skin tone like nothing I have tried. I am so grateful I can use this product with an easy mind, knowing it is made without toxins by a mindful company. I wish I could use it every day! I hope with regular use the benefits will become the norm. I highly recommend!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/prism-20-aha-exfoliating-glow-facial-treatment,5,2020-01-07,LOVE IT,"I received a free sample of this mask with my Black Friday 2019 purchase and tried it immediately, as I love the Prism Serum!
This definitely caused some purging for me but I think that is to be expected with concentrated chemical exfoliants - it’s getting rid of the dead skin cells on top so whatever is underneath that is gonna come out!
That being said, I love this mask. The gel-like consistency is amazing and easy to scoop out of the jar and put on. You can immediately see a difference in your skin after washing it off. Definitely produces a glowing complexion and makes your skin feel very soft and smooth.
I get hormonal acne but I’ve noticed I am not breaking out as much before my period with this in my rotation. I usually use this only once a week because it is pretty strong. This also pairs great with 4 drops of the Prism Serum and 2-3 drops of Lapis after you’ve washed the mask off if you are prone to breakouts like me. I also use the Blue Tansy face mask 3x a week, but adding the glow facial has definitely upped my glow game. ✨✨✨
All in all, this is 100% worth the price tag. I could see a full jar of this lasting more than a year since a little goes a long way and you’re only using it once a week. I’ll be purchasing this once my sample runs out!",,,,

I had previously used Prism and I thought that was amazing for my skin until I tried this. When I ran out of this product, I went back to Prism and realized my skin prefers this.

I purchased Phoenix oil, Prism glow serum & Pink Clay cleansing soap bar - WHOA!! - I'm beyond impressed! I noticed difference in my skin 2 days in! My skin now is glow-y, dewy and plump, I get questions and compliments from my colleagues at work about my skin. My make-up goes on smoother and looks good. I also recently purchased Pink Cloud moisture cream (I'm running out of my waaay-over priced cream - that did zelch) - I'm looking forward to using the moisturizer during the day (under my make-up during the warmer months).

It diminishes the look of my large pores and gives my skin a radiance that I’ve never had or haven’t had in a very long time.

Seeing results gives me more motivation to step Out of my comfort zone and continue to try new products. I now have almost the full line of herbivore. The only thing I would say that I would like different about this is the strength of the product. It is a little mild for my liking regardless this is an amazing product I give it a 10 out of 10.

Excellent spot treatment; fades acne scars quickly. I pair with Herbivore's Lapis and Emerald oils. HIGHLY recommend.

For comparison: I have used many of Herbivore's products and I have used many cult favorite exfoliators / retinols / retinoids. This tops both lists. I have purchased (and even repurchased) SR Good Genes, Omorovicza Acid Fix, Caudalie Glycolic Mask, Retin-A, Differin, Herbivore Prism, and more. This product makes my skin look so smooth and pearly-iridescent with practically no irritation whatsoever, even with daily use. The same cannot be said for any of the previously mentioned products.

I put it on at night before I go to bed and pair it with Emerald CBD (Herbivore recommends this combo to soothe the skin while exfoliating) and my skin looks and feels incredible in the morning. I have been using this for 10 days now and have definitely noticed less blemishes and a more even complexion. I will be back for more as soon as I run dry! Keep it up team HB!!,,,,

This oilhas helped reduce my redness and fine lines. I have sensitive skin and it is not bothered by Phoenix, but made beautiful and soft!

I love the rich smell and texture. I let my face tell me how much I need. A little goes a long way! I have noticed a big difference in fine lines when i use this as an eye moisturizer. It doesn't bother my eyes at all and has helped even out my dark circles and tiny wrinkles.

I now have a skincare ritual I look forward to every evening. Nightly I wash with pink clay soap, alternate with blue tansy and brighten, use the pink clay mask twice a week, then apply moon fruit and either lapis or phoenix.

After trialing 4-5 brands in the last half year, I stumbled upon herbivore, which has really complimented my skin. The whole line has been extraordinary the last two weeks but the Phoenix oil is the breadwinner. It goes on very light and absorbs into the skin within 20 minutes depending on how many drops you use.

 After the second day of use my face was soft, smooth and less oily. After two weeks I noticed the plumpness and youthfulness that I thought only surgery and needles could bring back.

I've noticed some skin tone improvements but yet to discover any rejuvenation effect or more miracle to happen. I am satisfied so far and no big pores issues as I've experienced before with another brand.

I have very sensitive skin and I was so thrilled that this facial oil was so gentle on my skin. I love the way it glides onto my skin and absorbs so nicely.

I have only been using this for approximately one week and there is a huge difference in the way my skin looks and feels. It is definitely more even toned, smoother, firmer and feels and looks beautiful. I can't tell you enough how wonderful this product is. When I was younger, my skin was oily and has remained so until about a year ago. So, this was really a challenge for me, as I'm not used to dealing with dryer skin. (My skin still would in no way be described as dry, but for me, it is.) I have tried other facial oils - jojoba and rose oil, to be exact and they were really unimpressive.

I'm so glad I did because Phoenix quickly became the oil I reached for the most! 

It feels lush, it goes on smoothly and soaks right into your skin. The scent is very fresh and not overpowering, but of course that is subjective. I use it twice a day under my moisturizer to really lock in long-lasting hydration, but I could see using this alone/on top of a moisturizer. It's perfect for this dry winter weather.

Of course she wanted to know what I used...when I told her, she said ""Oh"" and walked away... ahem.....

Especially thick oils! I cannot stand greasy or oily feelings from anything. I’ve even skipped lotion from time to time and I have combination skin, that is a little sensitive. I bought Herbivores travel sizes in the skin clarifying duo with the blue tansy mask and the lapis oil and the glow+hydrate with this Phoenix oil and I also got a deluxe sample size of the emerald hemp oil. It took me a long time to figure out which one was my favorite, lol because they all address different things. The hemp oil helps to calm any redness or irritation but it’s the thinnest out of the 3, in yet it still offers a ton of hydration. The lapis oil helps to balance sebum production, hydrates, heals acne and acne scars. The Phoenix oil hydrates the most, helps even skin tone, soothes irritation, hydrates and helps heal acne scars. Phoenix is my favorite because of the subtle (not overpowering) rose scent. I cannot even wear perfume because it causes headaches and all of the oils have amazing subtle scents! The lapis smells the strongest, though, like blue tansy. I overdo facials because I have a ton of time on my hands and love how I feel after doing them but I do them too often and it dries my skin out. After I started using these oils it hydrated my skin and kept it balanced, no acne, no blackheads, no irritation. I mean they just healed my skin completely. My skin does not feel oily with these on my face even after I apply serum and moisturizer first!!!! It feels dewy, loose and hydrated and so comfortable!! It takes some time to soak into the skin but once it does it is the best my face has ever felt in my life!! I even ran out for a week and my face was DYING!!! It felt so tight and dry, I could not take it! I bought another travel size of the hydrate and glow because I love the rose mist and the gemstone mask!! I definitely think atleast 1 herbivore facial oil is essential in anybody’s skin care routine because they are just made to heal skin.

The glass bottle and logo is beautiful and luxurious.

However if I'm going to pay 90 dollars for a product, of any sort, I'd expect a better dropper. I don't know if mine was just defective, but the oil came out the seems of the dropper since day one.

I've used facial oils before, but they tend to feel like I've slathered my face in grease. After reading all the amazing reviews I decided to give this roller a shot and I'm so glad I did!

This Phoenix oil is lightweight and absorbs instantly, not leaving any kind of film or residue. A little goes a long way. It instantly hydrates and keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day. The roller is super convenient, I apply it directly to my face. The scent is great, it's a refreshing addition to my morning routine!

While this oil is great for gentle hydration, I haven't noticed any improvement to the quality of my skin. This product claims reduction in fine lines/wrinkles, premature aging prevention, and overall restoration/revitalization, but so far I haven't experienced any results to my skin's appearance.

4 Stars - This oil now lives in my gym bag due to the above review... I swim for exercise and my skin gets sooo tight after I rinse off. So I decided to try this post pool and it works GREAT!

The oil will tint your skin orange so I could only use it at night. The smell was like rose hip oil infused pickle juice. Not pleasant.

People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, moon fruit, prism face mask, brighten face mask, and tansy face mask). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that. Orchid is the perfect moisturizing oil that brings a beautiful glow to my skin. ",Smoother; Hydrated; Brighter; Glowing; Even skin tone,35-44,Normal,Anti-Aging

Blue Tansy: I was very impressed how fast my results were, Lapis and Blue Tansy work really well together when clearing out acne. I Highly recommend getting both of them!!

I bought it because of the reviews it had on sephora and decided to try it for myself. I have a lot of post acne marks on my face and heard this mask was good for brightening and clearing. I applied it and washed it off like the box said to. After a month (and taking pictures every day I had used it to see progress) I couldn't believe how much lighter my scars were and my pores looked much less dilated. Nothing else has come close to giving me these results. Follow the steps as the little booklet describes and you'll be amazed. I will continue to rebuy over and over.,,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-08-28,This is the real deal,"I've had incredibly finicky skin since I hit puberty -- cystic acne all over my face, but also extremely dry and sensitive to most products. I finally went on Accutane when I was 19 and had a near perfect complexion for the next 8 years. Unfortunately, about year ago I started getting hormonal breakouts.

I tried so many different cleansers, brushes and masks that made little to no difference on my skin, and after a really horrible outbreak from using a Foreo device, I did extensive research on products that help inflamed, sensitive, acne-prone skin and this was recommended to me countless times. 

After one month of use, my skin is clear, bright and the tone is starting to even out. Because this product helps with inflammation, congestion and dryness, my pores appear smaller as well.

This is NOT just beautiful instagram fodder, Herbivore products are the real deal and I'll be serving recommendations to my pals. Thank you!!",,,,

I can only imagine that has everything to do with the Herbivore facial products I use. I just finished this mask and it lasted for months. Im now trying the other facial mask right now which is working well too. 

My only concern sometimes is when I use it... my skin feels like it burns but only for several seconds then stops. When I wash off my face looks and feels great so I wasn't too concerned but I am wondering if that is a normal experience with this? I will definitely purchase this one again.",,,,

It's only been two weeks and I'm already seeing a total resurfacing of my skin - I feel like I have my face back. It's amazing, and totally worth the price. The container size lasts for a really long time, it smells really great, has a lovely tingling feeling when you put it on, and isn't too sticky to apply or rinse off. Just for posterity, I have also been using it with a neem and turmeric wash beforehand, and you'll definitely want something to moisturize your skin with afterwards as it can be a little drying.

My skin texture has smoothed out so much with combined use of Lapis oil and this mask. You need to use very little product compared to other masks so this jar is a good value. I will definitely repurchase!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-05-05,Game changer,DAMN! I can’t explain how much this product along with the lapis oil has significantly helped with my acne scars and balanced my skin. It’s just thee product to have if you suffer from oily skin. It does wonder. However if you do have sensitive skin I would advise not to use this product. I did feel a slight tingling burning feeling when I applied the mask on. It’s the ingredients working it’s way into the skin. Trust me it’s worth it!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-04-28,Go-to blemish mask,"I got a sample jar with my recent Sephora Herbivore haul, and I use this on nights when my skin needs some extra help with blemishes. The next morning, my face has less whiteheads and any pimples have been reduced dramatically. I also like how it dries clear, and rinses off easily with warm water. ♡",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-04-22,Favorite mask,"This is the product that made an Herbivore convert out of me. I have combination skin, which this product is perfect for. It does tingle quite a bit, but not painfully so—just something to be aware of if you have sensitive skin. The results are worth it, though: a soft, glowing, healthy face. This is my twice-weekly ritual!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-04-17,Feels great!,I have sensitive and oil-prone skin. This mask does great things for me- clears and brightens. It’s also super calming and refreshing. I got this as a sample from Credo and it made me buy more Herbivore products.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-04-17,So far so good!,"After using this product one time, my skin was softer and seemingly less irritated from my acne. It does sting a little bit when youre wearing the mask but its not a burning sensation its more of a tingle. I definitely plan on buying it again once i run out!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-03-27,Combination skin saver,"After one use of this mask I saw visibly clearer skin. Also, when paired with the Lapis Oil, I have truly noticed a balancing of my combination skin. My T zone is less oily and around my nose isn’t dry or peeling at all! It’s a miracle!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-03-10,Amazing,"This product is amazing - I cannot say enough good things about Blue Tansy and Herbivore products in general!

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-02-23,A staple in my skincare routine,"This is by far one of my most repurchased item for my skin care. A little goes a long way and its a thinner consistency, my skin feels so soft each time I use this. I incorporate this into my nighttime skincare routine 1-2 times week and follow up with the Blue Tansy Oil. I especially use the mask and oil when I have hormonal breakouts, the following morning the size and redness are reduced. This mask along with the oil have definitely improve the redness and control my acne without being too harsh. I will continue to repurchase them, its a game changer in my skincare.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-02-08,Consistency is Key,"When I use this consistently, along with some Witch Hazel toner as an additional carrier for the Lapis oil, my face is smooth and clear! Its literally a matter of keeping on top of it like it says. Don't think that after 3-5 its cleared up, CONSISTENCY IS KEY!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-02-01,BUMPS BE GONE!,"I could cry I'm so happy with this product (and the Lapis Oil). I am 27 and didn't have acne when I was younger, but it decided to join me in adult life. For the last 2 years I have tried every regime you can think of including expensive products like Dermalogica and nothing helped remove the bumps on my forehead and chin (which are a constant with the occasionally huge cystic breakout). I read a lot about the cause of these tiny forehead bumps and thought I was doing the right thing to get rid of them, but ended up drying out my skin terribly and treating them with harsh chemical treatments. I waited to write this review until I had used Blue Tansy for a month. Do exactly what they tell you to do and use it more frequently during week one then maintain use weekly. You WILL see you skin texture improve and blemishes heal. I still have hormonal breakouts, and if you do too, DO NOT PICK. Use a natural spot treatment like the Cocokind Tumeric Spot Treatment stick - your skin deserves to be treated gently and it will work eventually even on cystic acne. I have extremely sensitive skin and was nervous about the BHA and AHAs in this product. There's a tingle for the first 5 minutes but then you feel your skin breathing and it's wonderful. THANK YOU HERBIVORE!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-01-18,One of the most amazing face masks I have ever used!!,Life-changing product! You can see great effect after first time you use it. Helped with my acne a lot! My skin is so smooth now! Also I have sensitive skin and can not use many produce but this one turned out to be brilliant!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2018-01-02,LOVE,I absolutely love this product!! It's the first one I tried and i fell in love immediately. As soon as I used it I noticed my face was less red and clearer within an hour after washing it off. The blue tansy face mask makes my face glow and makes me feel so confident. This is my favorite go too product and it lasts so long!!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-12-28,Results,"I never thought a natural product could be so effective. I wouldn't say I have troubled skin or sensitive skin, but I can see how this will help those who do. I use this mask when my skin needs to reset, especially if I have been using too many products or maybe having hormonal acne. I always keep my Blue Tansy Mask in the refrigerator, the feel of a cool gel mask on the skin is pure luxury! For anyone looking for a mask to treat textured skin or dull skin this is for you. I would recommend using it 3x a month or once a week to keep your skin glowing. Did I mention it doesn't burn or irritate. This is something I have to have in my life at all times!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-12-24,Currently on my 3rd Jar,"I’ve used several acid exfoliation masks but none of them are as comfortable AND give results like this one. My skin is never irritated or burned when I’m done with this mask (unlike a blood red copycat made by an Ordinary competitor). The smell is pleasant and I look forward to using it. The color will start to change—the blue becomes dull and darker— over time, but I find it still works. The fact that it changes just reaffirms that you’re using botanical ingredients. Currently on my third jar. I bought the smaller version with the travel Lapis oil, but once I’m out I will purchase both in full size. I love Herbivore products from the packaging to the effectiveness to the luxurious way the smell and feel.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-11-19,OH EM GEE BUY THIS RN,"When I purchased the tansy mask, I had hit my last resort. For whatever reason, I have been dealing with cystic acne only for the past 1.5 years or so. I also have fair and combination skin. Despite many facials, derm appointments, and injections into the actual blemishes nothing was working making sure I prevented those things from coming back. I followed the instructions and used the mask for 5 days in a row and holy moly. Minutes prior to writing this review, a huge cyst (1 cm) that had been brewing on my face all week began to drain. The red spots/scarring has decreased drastically and this is the first time in months that I can see my zits/cysts shrinking before my eyes. Thank you Herbivore for creating a miracle product! I just purchased my lapis oil and hope to continue seeing such amazing results. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-10-05,Wonderful Mask,"I have bought so many face masks over the years and used them only a handful of times before they sit and eventually get thrown out. This mask is the ONLY mask I have ever repeatedly used and looked forward to using. I have never noticed much of a difference in my skin after using products, but I noticed a difference after the first use with Blue Tansy. I have serious problems with blackheads and while this does not clear out blackheads (only extractions will) it does keep my skin clear in between extractions for me. My skin is glowing and soft and I always know that I will wake up having a good skin day after using this mask at night. 
Thank you!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-09-30,Perfect face mask,"I'm obsessed with this face mask. I love the look, the feel, the scent, and the results! It's perfect. It plays well with other skincare products in your routine, neither too harsh to cause excessive dryness nor too mild to be ineffective. I have serious combo skin (dry but acne-prone and oily T-zone) and this mask calms it all down. Whenever I'm having a particularly bad skin time, I use this a few evenings in a row and it really does speed up my skin's recovery and improvement time. It immediately visibly calms any breakouts, and does seem to prevent new ones. When I'm having good skin times, I use this maybe twice a week for maintenance. I've had it for almost a year now at this level of usage and am only just reaching the bottom of my jar. It's truly a wonderful product and is worth the price.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-09-29,Wow!,I really liked the feel of this! This helps with my pore problems and my face felt so fresh and clean! It is not messy to use and it helps me with my skin.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-09-27,My Holy Grail Product,"This product came into my life about 6 months ago & quickly became my holy grail product. When my skin is irritated & angry, I slather this all over & within 15-20 minutes, the redness & irritation decreases. This, in combination with the Lapis Oil, is indescribable. I typically incorporate this into my nighttime skincare routine (1-2 times a week), & the following morning, my skin is so rejuvenated. Any pimples or blemishes I may have had prior to putting this on are gone. I can always count on this product to provide incredible results. I will forever continue to purchase this mask. It seriously is a game changer!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-09-18,Really good value,"I got the deluxe sample size that was offered with orders $75 and up a few weeks ago; I assumed it would be enough for a few applications. I've now used this 4 times, and the little jar doesn't look like it's been touched! So the full sized jar would last a very long time. 

I'm dubious of anything that claims to be a miracle worker, but I have noticed a difference in my skin. Since I started using a moon fruit and the green tea toner at the same time, it's hard to know how much I can attribute to blue tansy specifically, but my skin definitely feels smoother after use. 

This is probably different from other masks you've used. It's got a very thin runny consistency, and it goes on clear; my only issue with that is it's hard to know at first glance if I've applied it evenly. A little goes a long way because it spreads so easily. The smell is strong but kind of pleasant, in a medicinal way. Once I run out of the sample, I'll definitely be purchasing the full size.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-09-12,Where has this been all my life,"Okay, I want to start by saying that my review is not just on this mask but also on the other products I use in conjunction to it. My skin type is oily, acne prone, slightly textured from past acne ( not too bad at all) and I have a lot of pink/red hyperpigmenteiton on my sheets from past acne. I've been using this for four days now I already see the hyperpigmenterion fading and I haven't had one break out. When I apply makeup the texture of my skin looks better, smoother, and my skin isn't oily at all! This is especially strange because my skin has always been so so oily. I use this with the blue and orange oils ( can't remember the names as I don't have the products in arms reach, but they're made by Herbivore Botanicals). I also use the blue and black soaps. Overall my hyperpigmentation is fading, which has always been my main concern, the texture of my skin has improved, my skin is not producing as much oil, and I have not had any break outs even though I usually break out a lot during the week for no apparent reason. I've seen so much improvement in the past four days and I'm excited to see how my skin will look in a month.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-09-11,Transformed My Skin,"I credit this mask with transforming my skin. I dont use it as often as I should because I live in a very sunny country and its also quite expensive but, whenever I feel like my skin needs an overnight transformation. I use this. You wont regret purchasing it.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-08-09,This mask is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!,"In my quest to find natural skincare products, I found this mask while doing some research. I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised. The mask has an earthy smell That isn't overwhelming. It does tingle but it's not at all harsh. Left my skin with an amazing glow and I followed up with the moon fruit night moisturizer. 

My only complaint is that it is a little runny but I may have applied a bit too much to my face. 

I must say that this is my new favorite exfoliating mask and I highly recommend it.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-08-03,Great mask!,"Such a great mask - really calming but also exfoliating. Make sure to wipe this off with a cloth though, otherwise you may have some dry patches of dead skin from the exfoliation",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-07-14,I found my holy grail.,"This mask is a miracle. I had given up all hope and was desperate for sth that can help my clogged pores and hormonal acne plaguing me a whole year when i stumbled upon this product in the Sephora mailer cos i was intrigued by its colour. I was this close to going back on Accutane again at 35. 

i read the reviews, found out what it was, googled somemore and read *more* reviews, all the while extremely skeptical about how everyone is raving about it. But i have become one of these ppl omg!

I can't believe this actually works, after 1 use, i woke up the next day and i can see a difference! After 2nd night I can tell my pimple scars lightened, the redness of infected acne also calmed down lots, cystic acne swelling gone. Today is the 4th night i'm using this as i am following the instructions of using it everyday for the first 4 days, and next week onwards i will continue using it twice a week for maintenance. 

I love the herbal smell, not a problem for me. It's easy to remove with a wash cloth, 3 wipes max and everything is clean and your skin feels fresh! I hope this will eventually clear out my clogged pores, slowly but surely, together with the Lapis Oil which i ordered on a whim as well.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-07-10,The Real Deal,"I have used this product for four nights in a row and I can definitely see results. As it dries you can feel a light tingle. I leave it on for 30 minutes or so. It's important to use a washcloth when removing the mask, because although it does rinse off with warm water alone there is a surprising amount of exfoliation and you're going to want to gently wipe the dead skin cells from your face. I can already see a reduction in red marks from old acne, and my skin just looks and feels so much better. I've also been using the charcoal soap, rose mist, moonfruit, and lapis oil. Overall I am extremely pleased and feel that the cost is worth the results. I have hormonal acne and excessive oiliness, and I'm seeing better results with this line than I was with Proactive AND I feel so much better about what I am putting on my face. The packaging and scents get added bonus points....the whole experience just feels very luxurious. I highly recommend.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-07-03,Miracle Worker,"This is truly my favorite skin product! I have extremely sensitive skin and rosacea, so I'm always wary of face masks as they usually do more harm than good- but this one is soothing, cooling, and gentle enough to rinse off instead of peeling. It leaves my skin soft, calms redness (a huge problem for me), helps to dry and clear out blemishes more quickly, and even leaves a little bit of a ""glow"". I love the scent, too. I've used it as directed and two weeks in, I couldn't be much happier!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-07-03,LOVE,"I have had acne-prone skin for 10+ years, and in the past year or so, have experienced cystic acne worse than ever. It came on suddenly, no idea why, and wreaked havoc on my face. I am in the process of taming it, but I still get pimples frequently, have scars to try and heal, and also my face feels dirty just in general. I have now been using Blue Tansy mask + Lapis oil for about 2 weeks, and my face is SOOOO much smoother, so clean, zits are less frequent, and I feel like the redness is fading. I love mask days, because this stuff smells amazing and as soon as I rinse it off, I can feel a difference in how smooth my skin is. I am very happy with my progress so far and can't wait to see what the future of the Blue Tansy holds!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-06-28,Holy grail,"I wish I could give this a billion more stars. I can't even begin to explain the wonders this does for my face. As I got older I started to get adult acne. This is the first product that actually works. Not only does it soothe my face but it leaves my skin so smooth and glowing! I use it at least twice weekly if not three times. It smells like freshly brewed tea, herbal but subtle. It's so easy to apply! The littlest amount goes such a long way. Don't be afraid of the price. The product can last a long time if used wisely. I'm so happy I stopped using chemicals on my face. You don't realize the harm until you truly research it. So happy for such a great, natural brand. Beyond thankful I stumble along herbivore botanicals. The blue tansey mask is a must have. Y'all saved my face. Please, don't ever change a thing. All your products are amazing!!",,,,

After 5 day of using it, my face is so clean! Even my stubborn blackheads on my nose are all cleared, then after that I switched to once in 2-3 days to maintain the cleansed and glowing face! I am definitely gonna buy this again in Sephora because in Malaysia there's no way I could get this awesome product except Sephora online.",,,,

The price tag was a little scary, but as a devoted Fresh user, I know you get what you pay for.. 

Let me start off by saying at first I thought I was allergic, red spots starting appearing and pimple started coming to a head before my eyes! I left the mask on though because I wanted it to do its thing... Fast forward a couple days and my skin feels amazing!! I literally had a few acne scars completely disappear!!

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-05-23,Tears of Joy,"I have been struggling with acne and scars for almost two years. I even invested in laser hair removal as the majority of it was on my cheeks and chin where I had excessive hair. Even with the laser treatment I continued to struggle. I have been using this for a month now and I am in tears. For the first time in two years I am almost ready to go back to not using foundation every single day. I spent a fortune on various products, treatments, and research. Late last year I made it my goal to use natural products because I have a problem reading ingredients I can not pronounce and figured that could not possibly be good for my skin. I did not want to believe in this product at all, but after the third week I was expecting to have my monthly breakout, it was a day of small pop ups, and they were settled within the next two days with minimal scaring. When I go to the tennis courts I no longer have to worry about my red patches or mismatched pigmentation. This is an amazing product and I am so thankful to have found it and my confidence again.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-05-20,"Smaller pores, fewer breakouts","I started using Herbivore in January after I wasn't seeing the results I wanted from other expensive brands and wanting to switch to a more natural plant based product. I fell in love after the first week!

This mask has helped reduce my redness. I have sensitive skin and it is not bothered by Blue Tansy, but made beautiful and soft.

The smell wasn't my favorite but has grown on me. I love the gentle tingling this provides on application.

I followed the recommendations in the package insert. I first started with a week of Blue Tansy, then Brughten. It made a world of difference!

I now have a skincare ritual I look forward to every evening. Nightly I wash with pink clay soap, alternate with blue tansy and brighten, use the pink clay mask twice a week, then apply moon fruit and either lapis or phoenix.

My skin has tightened, has a nice glow, my pores are significantly cleaner and smaller; I rarely have to use foundation (unless I'm feeling fancy)...highly recommend!",,,,

(I never had skin problems growing up, so it has been a huge bummer to have major issues in my early 20's) While this product hasn't solved my acne problem (nothing has!) it's definitely helped the overall appearance of my skin SO much. I didn't really believe it would be exfoliating since there's no ""scrub"" involved, but wow - it seriously leaves my skin smoother than just about any product. It also really helps even skin tone, and has improved some of my long-standing acne scars! I feel good about the ingredients, knowing they're natural, and not too harsh for my skin. This is really worth the money. Oh, and it smells AMAZING. At first, I just wanted to use it every day because I loved the smell so much. It's very herbal and natural smelling, so it might be different if you're used to artificial fragrances, but this is much healthier for your skin and body.",,,,

The mask is light, dries quickly and has not caused any problem for me. I followed the instruction to use 5 days consecutively and the result was great-supple/balanced skin with clarity and much less redness and or acne. I have pretty much every product from Herbivore other than the lip balms and bath salts.

I used it as directed for the first five days every other day and then kept it in my routine 1-2 times a week depending on my skin's needs. The very first time I used it I saw my skin change in a way I hadn't seen in quite some time. It was so clear, smooth and even. I use it at night and always wake up with beautiful skin. I have very dry skin and have a few areas, like around my nose, where I there are dry patches of flakey skin that is hard to tame -- but after using this it removed all the dead, flakey skin and completely resurfaces my face. I love the tingling feeling when wearing the mask...it feels great and cooling! I absolutely love this stuff! Also, it helps with acne. Whenever I have a blemish on my face, I notice SIGNIFICANT reduction the next morning. I used with the Lapis facial oil and I feel it keeps my blemishes at bay. It's incredibly good. Little goes a long way. and it's not very drying. Give it a try!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-02-10,Clears up chin acne and small white bumps,"I purchased this product 2 weeks ago and I am so glad I listened to all the rave reviews. I used this 4 nights in a row and the cystic pimple mark on my chin has diminished along with the 3 - 4 active acne lesions I had on my right jaw/cheek line. If you suffer from clogged pore or hormonal/cystic acne this blue mask is for you. After 2 nights use all of my red,clogged active acne areas became whiteheads and were then easily removed the next morning. 
Also - I have sensitive Irish skin that does not like any harsh products or masks, but this mask made my skin less red/irritated and more smooth. I recommend this to everyone!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-02-09,I can't even describe how much I love this!,"This is my absolute, all time favorite HB product! I just keep repurchasing once I run out. It's gentle enough that I can use it daily if need be, but typically use it 3-4 times a week (in combination with the whitening mask). It's great at drying up blemishes and killing them quickly while getting rid of any redness. This, plus the whitening mask, is the best 1-2 punch to my stupid hormonal breakouts.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-02-07,Beautiful Skin and Product,I have very sensative skin that also happens to be plagued by hormonal acne. This product has cleared up my acne without drying my face out or causing a reaction. I love the smell and the way my face looks now. I'm so happy I now have the product. Thank you Herbivore for making a product that makes me feel confident enough to not wear makeup every time I walk outside.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-01-25,Magic !,"It works almost like mythical legend or something, y'know. When applied, your pores and blackhead are getting visually accented...like...it's opened and the gooey mask catch 'em one by one. The result? Smoother skin and less extroverted pores! LOL yes, extroverted. :)) 

Anyway, the smell reminds me of random traditional Indonesian or Indian spices. :)",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2017-01-21,Cleared old and new cystic acne,"I have been searching far and wide for a product that actually treated my cystic acne, and I came across this product thanks to Urban Outfitters. I was scared of the price tag, but the product ingredients were so pure and simple and not full of BS. I read reviews that because it was so simple in ingredients, it's very potent. I used it according to the recommendation of using it for 3 nights in a row. it raised my old and new cysts to the surface and erased them. I used it once a week following that, but when i got another cyst, I used it 3 nights in a row again, and the cyst minimized FAST. I love this product and the brand so much. I can tell that these products are made with love.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-12-30,My skin loves this product!,"This product is my new holy grail! I have very dry, acne-prone skin with a lot of hyper pigmentation spots. Since using this stuff for about 3 weeks now I've already noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. It is less dry, has less texture, and my red spots are fading faster than they have with any other product. I have sensitive skin but this mask is not too strong at all. I still leave it on for about 20 minutes and have't had any issues. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-12-28,So (SO) Impressed,"Having the great fortune of both cystic acne and sensitive, flakey, upper Midwest winter skin -- it's taken me awhile, but I feel confident in my skincare scavenging abilities. 

Herbivore, and particularly this mask, have been total game changers in my routine. I emphasize results, ingredients, and experience -- and this product delivers on all three. 

I started using this mask with several oncoming cysts and rashy, flakey dryness (too many holiday dance parties). After finishing the suggested five day intro (with Rose Hibiscus Water + Lapis Oil), I noticed a drastic improvement not only with the blemishes, but with my skin's overall surface quality. Not only that, the products themselves + the packaging all give a sense of luxury with every use. 

Awesome customer service and products that work (gentle but effective). The system also pairs well with other skincare companies. I'm so happy to continue supporting this brand. Thank you!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-12-04,WOW.,"This mask is the only product I would ever call HG. I've purchased it three times (one of those times was because I broke a brand new jar on second use, boy was I mad). 

I first got it in the S/S 2016 set. I read all about it and was pretty wary about putting it on my face, but my skin was already a total wreck and couldn't have gotten much worse. Last winter I developed full blown acne patches on my cheeks, which had ALWAYS been clear. This mask cleared that right up. Like, instantly. When those patches developed again this fall, this was the first thing I reached for. My skin is smoother, brighter, and any blemishes I have clear up within days.

I have sensitive skin but use this for 20 minutes. I love that it's gentle enough to be used for consecutive days for instant results. When I'm good about using it for four days as directed, then once a week or so for upkeep, my skin stays radiant and clear. When I get lazy, I like knowing that all I have to do is grab this pretty glass jar.

The scent is pretty strong, but I like it. I love blue tansy. This mask smells a lot like Luna oil, but sweeter and sharper? It's easy to apply and a little goes a long way. Even so, I do find I go through it pretty quickly, but it's totally worth it to me. I follow up with Rose Hibiscus Coconut Water and Lapis oil (also from the S/S set and repurchased). My skin has never looked better. I will never go without this again.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-10-31,Amazing! No Alcohol,"Finally a product that has NO ALCOHOL!! This mask does wonders at clearing your face. I tried it last year and have been repurchasing ever since. Unfortunately, their new product ""Moon Fruit"" does have alcohol, otherwise I would be all about it too. Please DONT ever change the formula!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-10-27,Great product!,"This mask did a very good job of helping to clear my skin. I put it on four days in a row to begin, and by the fourth day my acne had dramatically improved. It is a very comfortable mask to have on too; doesn't over-dry and isn't sticky or uncomfortable. 

Also, Herbivore's customer service is amazing. I was unsatisfied with a product and they immediately took unprecedented action to make things right. They are an honest business who cares about their customers. I highly recommend their products!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-09-30,Worth it,"Just bought this product, however I've been running off samples of this from Sephora, and I truly love it. I am a mask-aholic, and this has to be my go-to mask. It has really help kept my acne at bay, but also smoothes and reduces the uneven skin I once had. I sometimes sleep with a thin layer on over night to really let it sink in, and then wash it off in the morning, revealing such soft skin. Can't wait to get my product in the mail. Also I'm just loving the brand in general. Local, fresh, and natural are just a few of the reasons that caught my attention. Definitely will be watching for new products!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-09-18,Gentle but effective!,"This mask is super gentle but does an unbelievable job of evening out skin tone, and making your skin so much smoother! it brightens and plumps skin up after just a few uses. I have super sensitive skin and didn't react to this mask at all. In fact, it had a calming and cooling effect. I started using this mask two months before my wedding and was terrified that it would make my skin worse before it made it better, like so many other products usually do. Instead, it worked instantly. Bonus is that the jar lasts several months, so it's actually pretty cheap when you consider the number of times you can use it! I Highly recommend it!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-09-16,Improve skin texture,"I use this mask on a weekly basis but I definitely can see the results on the first week I use this mask. I noticed a HUGE improvement on my skin texture, skin looks brighter and a lot smoother as if I just scrub my face. The mask also helps to clear bigger pimples but didn't do much on my clog pores (well nothing seems to help). The smells is something you need to get used to it. It is a great investment as one jar can last you a looooong time.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-08-25,No more adult acne,"I was impressed with how this product left my skin feeling after two days of use. My skin is smoother and I have almost no breakouts. The large pores on my nose are smaller and I don't have to use an extraction tool anymore!!! I have been using it as instructed for two weeks and I haven't even made a dent in the jar, a little goes a long way. Will be purchasing again. Its embarrassing to walk into the office or a meeting with adult acne but I feel so much more confident now.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-07-06,Smells and works great!,I really like this product. It does a great job at exfoliating my skin and it smells amazing. Half the reason I use it is because of how lovely it smells. And I can see chronic blackheads diminishing more after each use. I can't wait to incorporate more of your skin care line in to my daily use.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-07-05,Can I give it more stars???,"I've been struggling with hormonal acne for over 15 years. I'm 34 years old, fair skinned, and extremely oily; I'm in a constant state of breakout, with varied severity depending on my cycle. I've tried a ridiculous amount of various products, programs, supplements, treatments and facials, all with little to no result. I finally got around to trying Herbivore's Blue Tansy Mask and I could cry- happy tears! Why have I not had this for years?? I've used this mask every day for the past 7 days and my skin has improved dramatically. After only the first use I noticed a HUGE improvement in my hyperpigmentation. I will never go without this mask again!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-06-30,LOVE IT,"Amazing. The easiest, least messy mask I've used. It slowly takes layers off your skin - most products that exfoliate & resurface are harsh and drying. NOT WITH THIS PRODUCT :) If you have dark spots and/or cystic acne, this was made for you.",,,,

I first used the mask at night and the following morning received several compliments! Someone even thought I had a facial. I have been using the product regularly for almost two weeks now. My skin has remained smooth and glowing.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-05-19,Cleanest mask I've ever used!,"Not only is this mask excellent because it doesn't require you to mix anything, it works well, too! I have sensitive skin so followed the instructions to leave it on for shorter periods the first few times I used it but it didn't bother my skin at all. My skin felt noticeably smoother after using it just once. Love how easy it goes on, washes off, and the smell is to die for!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-05-13,"Bye bye, whiteheads!","I really wasn't expecting this mask to do anything for me, as I've already tried so many products before to clear my constantly broken out skin, but this blue beauty has restored my hope for clearer days. I rarely get red, angry pimples & few blackheads, but whiteheads have plagued my skin for years. As instructed, I applied it for the first five days. By the third day my skin was noticeably less congested & by the fifth the army of whiteheads that had been residing on my cheeks & jaw had nearly been wiped out. I will continue to use this glorious product until I finally have the clear skin I've been dreaming about for so long. I am so grateful to Herbivore Botanicals for having created this product. Five stars & a couple happy tears from this girl.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-05-10,Buy this right now,"I've tried antibacterials, retinoids, and a clarisonic to clear away my terrible acne. Nothing has helped. 

Blue Tansy saved me. It started clearing my skin right away. I hesitated buying this mask because it is a bit expensive. But I wish I had bought this when I initially bought the charcoal soap and lapis oil roller two months ago. I use a thin layer of the mask about 4 times a week on my sensitive skin and now I only wear a bit of concealer during the day.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-05-10,New Favorite Mask,"I was hesitant to order because I'm not used to spending that much on my skincare products but there's no doubt it's worth it. I've had fewer breakouts, smoother skin and more confidence. I can tell this product will last me a good long while, too which makes the price point easier to swallow. Love it and highly recommend it especially to anyone with oily/acne prone skin.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-05-02,Amazing!!!,"After only 3 days of using the mask, my pores shrunk and my complexion is bright and smooth!!! I follow the mask with the Lapis facial oil",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-04-14,Love!,I love using masks. Use one almost every night. I was very excited to try this after reading all the glowing reviews. I'm so very glad I did! Love this mask! The smell is very soothing. It feels cooling on my skin. I have been using it for a little over a week now and my skin feels and looks amazing.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-04-13,So in love.,"I have fairly acne-prone skin, so I practically live with face masks on at all times. I'm always looking for a good AHA or BHA, so this twofer is like magic for me. After just a couple of uses I was hooked. My skin has legitimately never looked better, and I tell everyone I know about this mask.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-04-13,So far so good,"I had to laugh because my experience mirrored the other Lindsay Marie's review exactly and my name is also Lindsay Marie :). I'm giving this item 5 stars because a week in it has already met my expectations and I have a feeling it's going to surpass them greatly. 

I have been using this product for a week now and have already noticed a difference in the redness and inflammation of my skin. I use it combination with the Lapis oil and toner. I have very sensitive skin pair with Polymophic Light Eruption and my skin has so far reacted positively to with this.

I would LOVE an item with retinol or an ingredient of similar potency and efficacy for hyperpigmentation. My skin looks so much worse than it actually is due to the leftover marks of past acne. 

Also, I emailed the team as a NEWBIE to skincare and Max sent back a FANTASTIC email with great detail. Bravo to great customer service and great products!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-04-11,Holy grail mask!,"This product REALLY did change my complexion and my life. The smell is GLORIOUS! Super gentle, even on my extremely sensitive skin. Before this mask, I was irritated, dry, suffering from a few eczema patches along with clogged pores and blemishes. Within the first week of use my face has a made a miraculous transition. I threw out all my other masks. This is the only one I will ever use, ever again.",,,,

I suffer from cystic acne and tons of little blemishes. Since using this mask, I have NOT had any cystic breakouts and my skin has never looked this clear and radiant! Finally at 33, I have better skin than I did a few months ago! Thank you for this product!! I'm thinking I'm going to try it in conjunction with the Lapis oil and hopefully I will be one happy chick!!!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-02-26,Great for red breakouts,I am newly pregnant which means my hormones are going crazy making my face super red and irritated all the time. My friend had some of this mask for me to try and the redness went away after. I have super sensitive skin so I put a timer on and followed directions about how long to leave it on. I did end up leaving it on longer than recommended for sensitive skin because I did not notice anything bad happening when I did a test patch. It tingles but do not freak out!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-02-21,The Perfect Remedy!,"A couple weeks ago, I bought a rose Lush mask that broke my skin out terribly. Nothing would work to help calm down my trouble spots and I was starting to get frustrated.

I normally have very sensitive skin, so it's hard for me to buy products online without trying them first, but after seeing the great reviews on here, I felt confident that the blue tansy mask might help alleviate some of my irritation.

SO SO HAPPY THAT I MADE THIS PURCHASE! Even after using it once, I noticed a huge difference. The redness and irritation from the rose mask completely disappeared, and after 4 uses, almost the entirety of the breakout has disappeared. It even helps alleviate some darker spots and scars you may have -- a total plus!

I use the lapis oil afterwards as a moisturizer which makes my skin so soft! I have more oily skin too and the face oil helps balance my complexion. I don't get shiny as often throughout the day! 

Thanks Herbivore for saving me from other ""natural"" products. I definitely have become a huge fan!",,,,

I love taking a warm cloth and removing the mask, revealing super soft baby skin. I've only used it for two weeks but in combination with the oils (I use Lapis and Orchid) I really see a huge difference in my skin. Softer. Less breakouts and redness. Glowing. I use BLUE TANSY in the morning, every few days and then use BRIGHTEN every few days in the evening.",,,,

I have to say that I am impressed by the Aquarius moisturizer though. This moisturizer is moisturizing without being oily. It also keeps my skin clear from breakouts.

I had read a previous review about the Aquarius cream helping with overall congestion in the face. I struggle with a lot of sinus congestion from allergies and Gua Sha when I can to help with any drainage. I knew I wanted to try the cream and my friend had also been recommending to me the pink cloud jelly cleanser. To my surprise I have noticed a big difference post applying the Aquarius cream! My face looks slimmer minutes later and is one of my knew favorite products to add into my de-puffing routine. I’ve now switched my cleanser to using the pink jelly cloud one and enjoy using the blue tansy mask 1-2 times a week for smoother texture. I recommend this kit to anyone who is looking to start using Herbivore especially if you’re looking for something to help de-puff the face and clear congestion.,Softer; Glowing; Hydrated; Reduced redness; Firmer,25-34,Oily,"Anti-Aging, Sensitivity, Oiliness, Pores, Dullness"

The moisturizer melts & absorbs into my skin so quick I was taken aback. & the mask, calms my skin, & cleared it..as well as my sinuses (smells like starbursts candy fused w/vapor rub) lol but I like weird scents so it doesn't bother me. My skin is very sensitive & gets irritated a lot, I can't do a regular routine like most, because my skin can't handle it. I can only moisturize once a day in the AM, a mask once a week, & the cleanser three times a week. & a little goes a very long way w/these products so I don't need much of them which is also nice.

This allows me to cleanse my face and it feels so soft and hydrated even before I add oil to my face.

I was a little skeptical about it when head about it from a skincare guru a few months ago that has helped do wonders for my skin (Ben Neiley). Now, I have 3 other cleansers I love, but this one was made for gentle nights and good mornings. The jelly like consistency melts seamlessly into a velvety cream texture on the skin, paired with a subtle floral scent. The cleanser was a dream. It effectively cleansed my skin, but left it feeling more moisturized than before I used it. I don’t wear make up ,but I do wear a mineral sunscreen everyday. It says that it can effectively remove either in the cleanse, but I regularly double cleanse and can’t speak on that. I will say that it does feel effective, and not overtly drying or irritating in any way. I have combination acne-prone skin, and this has not flared up any of that. I would highly recommend this cleanser for anyone wanting a soft yet effective cleanse. I would say this would be better for anyone with dry to combination skin, but would still be a good choice with oily skin.

As much as I want to make sure this cleanser stays in stock forever and always, I also feel compelled to share how amazing it is so that hopefully it will help others who've struggled with their skin. 
* TL;DR: After several years of struggling with acne, trying many top-rated products along the way, this cleanser has me actually feeling good when I look in the mirror. I don't shy away from my reflection anymore or feel that sense of defeat and despair over a futile battle with acne; my skin is the clearest it has been in several years, and I'm so, so, SO happy about it! *

My journey is shared below, but I think it's worth mentioning that my husband (who works construction in the tropics) has also experienced a significant improvement to his skin using this cleanser with no other changes to his routine. He uses this cleanser (after work, he also pre-cleanses with an oil cleanser and then follows with the Pink Cloud), a gel moisturizer, Herbivore beard oil, and when working, applies lots of generic mineral sunscreen.

SKIN BACKGROUND: I started experiencing persistent acne in my mid-20's; I'm guessing this is due to health issues that also started becoming a noticeable issue around the same time. I've been told my hormone levels are at ""perimenopausal levels"" even though I'm only just now 30 (lucky me). So I think most of my acne issues are due to hormonal imbalances, but I'm not totally sure. I also live in a tropical climate and worked full-time (up until COVID) in a restaurant with no a/c, but even after being in lockdown at my new home that's in an elevated cooler climate, the acne persisted. I went vegan about a year after first developing cystic acne, and while that did help calm things down a lot and resulted in less of the cystic kind and reduced overall inflammation, I continued to have regular acne. I next got rid of my drugstore cleansers and face products and started desperately trying more high-end products, hoping for a solution. Racked up lots of Sephora points, eventually found Credo & Detox Market and started trying more plant-based products, scoured reviews, and spent hundreds of dollars each year, hoping this product or that regimen would finally do the trick, but nothing seemed to give me the clear-faced results I so desperately wanted.

PINK CLOUD CLEANSER RESULTS: I wasn't even actively searching for a solution anymore and had more or less resigned myself to having a face I hated to see in the mirror due to all the redness and acne, which really stands out on my pale skin. I just figured I'd do the best I could and deal with it. One day, I decided to try this cleanser after noticing a lot of others saying it was their holy grail cleanser. I saw some reviews who felt differently, but of course, we all have different skin types and troubles. Almost on a whim, I ordered a bottle, not even investing the hopes and dreams into it that I had in the past for so many other products. I knew I liked my other Herbivore products and figured it was worth trying this one. It took about a month for my skin to get really nice and clear. Because it wasn't super immediate and I had also started a new medication about a week before noticing the clear skin results, I didn't make the connection to the cleanser at first. I thought it was the medication. But then I ran out of the cleanser and it was out of stock so I couldn't order more. Much to my despair, my face returned to its acne-covered state. I realized it wasn't the medication at all. I set up a notification via Herbivore's website to be alerted when the cleanser came back in stock, and as soon as it did, I ordered 2 bottles. I'm now about a month in to using this cleanser again, and lo and behold, my face is pretty darn clear. It's not flawless, but it is DRAMATICALLY better than it is without this cleanser. There are no glaring blemishes, just a few small ones here or there, but I really cannot stress enough how much BETTER it is. I have no cystic acne, no painful or obvious pimples. Overall, there is reduced redness, a more even and smooth complexion, and just a generally improved appearance. I hope that with continued use of this and my other products as well as drinking lots of water and eating clean, I'll be able to see further improvement. (Also seeing an endocrinologist, virtually, for the first time next month so I'm excited to hopefully get my hormones more balanced as well!) When the Pink Cloud Moisture Creme comes back in stock, I'm going to try it, too.

CURRENT REGIMEN:
- AM cleanse with Pink Cloud Cleanser
- in the AM I follow this with a gel cream moisturizer from another brand but I want to try swapping out for the Pink Cloud Moisture Creme when I can get my hands on it
- if I'm going to be out in the sun, I substitute a moisturizing mineral face sunscreen for the gel cream moisturizer
- PM cleanse with Pink Cloud Cleanser
- in the PM I follow this with Herbivore's Emerald CBD oil 4 days out of the week and the other 3 I use their Bakuchiol smoothing serum
- after either my PM Herbivore face oil or serum, I put on a face + eye ceramide cream
- about once every other week or so, not with any particularly strict regularity, I use Herbivore's Blue Tansy resurfacing clarity mask

In the past I have tried high end brands and drugstore brands.

And I know it’s the cleanser because when I make a change, I change one thing at a time in case of reaction.
I have mild rosacea and a lot of sun damage, normal size pores, sort of drying mature skin. I don’t wear much makeup so one pump is plenty. When I do wear tinted sunscreen or foundation, this cleanser easily removes it completely with no drying.

I was a little skeptical about it because of the smell reviews, my skin type, and what I was looking for. But like I said I’ve tried everything so i figured 24$ was worth a shot.

I am 27, wear medium to heavy makeup, have combo skin. Sometimes I’m oily and have blemishes and sometimes I’m dry and patchy. I have slight rosacea and eczema.

This stuff smells amazing. Just like roses! This stuff washes off every bit of makeup without having to scrub too hard. It leaves my face feeling soft and not stripped of oil, and I feel like it gives me the perfect clean! This product in combination with the green tea toner and the prism oil have combatted my acne and maskne! I recommend buying these three products for any acne prone skin.

The lapis oil works wonders with my rosacea and redness. I use this oil on those days.

As of this year, I really dove into skincare and learned better... and came across this bad boy. Wow I’m impressed. And I think the best part about it is that it 100%,  I’m not kidding, wipes off ALLL of my makeup in the shower. So you know how some cleansers will still leave you with raccoon eyes once you get out of the shower? Not with this one. I genuinely feel like my face is thoroughly clean afterwards.

My skin has learned to regulate its own oils again and I only use the Emerald serum on days where I will be applying makeup so it doesn't dry out.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/pink-cloud-rosewater-tremella-creamy-jelly-cleanser,5,2020-08-14,The best cleanser I’ve ever used on my skin,"I’m “natural” when it comes to skin care, and for about 2 years I’ve been using Acure cleansers but was still having some slight redness and tightness. After trying the sample size of this cleanser, I immediately bought the full size product once it launched. The product smells nice, it is a smell similar to the old pink cloud moisturizer but VERY faint. It does not lather to suds but has some mild lather that I was initially skeptical of (I like a lather). On my skin it glides like jelly and feels soothing, I’ve even started to let it sit on my skin for a while like a mask before easing it off. My skin is left feeling amazing, hard to describe perfection. My skin feels supple and clean at the same time— not tight, not oily, moisturized, and smooth. I don’t like to waste and usually force myself to finish old products before starting new ones, but I can’t find it in me to stray back to my old cleaners to finish them knowing how my skin looks and feels with Pink Cloud. I also enjoy the price point for the size. Products under 30 dollars are sustainable for long term use and I’ll be using this as long as you make it. I look forward to hopefully getting the moisturizer back to match. Thank you!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2022-01-14,It actually really works better than most products I've tried!,"I'm in my mid 30s with combination skin prone to all the different kinds of acne - whiteheads, blackheads, cystic, hormonal, eczema, etc. I've been breaking out since I was 10. My mother had acne. My brother has severe acne. I tried every over the counter product sold for the past 20+ yrs, been to dozens of dermatologist appointments (that made my skin the worst, ironically), tried many prescriptions. Nothing ever worked, most products make my skin worse. 

A few months ago I stumbled upon this. I bought it on a whim along with a dozen other new products.  Out of everything new I bought/tried, and out of everything I tried in years past, this stuff works the best. The scent is lovely. It hydrates your skin without feeling greasy or shiny. I even tried a similar blue tansy serum from a different company and it did nothing compared to this Lapis serum (I think the other company diluted their serum too much). My whiteheads/blackheads have reduced by over 60% in just under 2 months. Cystic and hormonal acne is almost nonexistent, and the breakouts I do have heal completely in just a few days instead of the weeks/months they took to heal before. Pores/scars are greatly diminished. My skin looks the best it has in years. Inflammation from clogged pores shrinks down to almost nothing. It somehow hydrates my dry cheeks without greasing up my T zone. I feel like my skin would be happy just using this alone, though I do layer it with other products. I use benzoyl peroxide once every 2-3 days first, or a ""buffer"" serum with hylauronic acid and peptides. Then I use Lapis - about 5-6 drops on my face and 2-3 on my neck and chest. Then I use a moisturizer (on dry days) or sunscreen. Then I top it off with a few drops of either one of a couple of ""barrier building""-type pore minimizing/anti inflammatory serums/moisturizers I've been experimenting with, though I keep noticing that THIS serum is the key each day. The others products I use don't have as immediate and drastic results. My skin never looked so good without makeup. My skin tone seems even and healthy, not patchy and blotchy like before. I immediately bought a 2nd bottle after a week of using this, and now it's almost 2 months and I've used 1/10th of the first bottle. It's pricy. but VERY worth it.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2021-08-07,Goodbye acne!,"I got this in the jewel box and I love it!

I have tricky skin. I get small zits and clogged pores, but nothing cystic. The zits turn to little scabs that seem to never heal. It can take over a month sometimes, and I hate it. Unfortunately my skin is also extremely dry, but whenever I try to add moisture I break out more. I don't even want to think about how much money I've spent over the years buying products that haven't worked. Lately the flaky skin has been awful on my nose due to wearing masks. I have raw patches on my nose that seem to never heal, just continually flake.

I started using one drop each of the Phoenix, Emerald, and Lapis oils after my moisturizer at night. In the morning I do the same thing, but before my moisturizer because that one has SPF and I don't want to rub it away.

My skin has changed DRAMATICALLY in only 3 days! Zero new zits, my skin absolutely glows, and my scabs/raw patches have already healed so much! I'm 31 and starting to get some fine lines on my forehead, and they're already less noticeable. I think it's because of how well this oil is hydrating and plumping my skin.

Lapis is a holy grail product for me. Smells incredible, and clears my acne while hydrating my skin at the same time.

I'm so relieved to have found these products that I want to cry. I'm finally on my way to the skin I've always wanted. The oil is very rich and concentrated, so don't be scared of the cost. It goes a long way. I have the mini, and I can tell that tiny bottle will last about 2 months.",,25-34,Combination,"Acne, Dryness, Dullness, Sensitivity, Anti-aging"

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2021-07-31,Oil of Your Dreams!!!,"Okay, so I admit the color was what first drew me in…the gem-like quality was almost hypnotic.  My daughter had been injured on her face and I researched oils rather intensively to find the best one to help her heal both faster, and to prevent it from becoming a scar.  This led me to the blue tansy oil, and over time, as she healed, with hardly a sign of her injury in a most miraculous way, the side effect was her complexion became clearer as well.  I ended up putting both my husband and myself on the oil as well, and this stuff just works!!! The sandalwood in conjunction with it, is like the dynamic duo that calms redness that can appear as rosacea or just flat out high color in those who exhibit high emotion, like myself, because I have kids and life and stress happens to affect my skin color ;)  (think Princess Diana who had to have green makeup on her wedding day to cover her redness from high emotion).  At any rate, this works best used in very small amounts after first spritzing with a mist/toner of preferred type and then lightly patted in everywhere. In drier parts of the country, or wintertime with drier environments then more may be used, but in humid parts of the country, less will be more.

My skin felt softer and smoother and the large pores near my nose were visibly smaller. Plus, as promised, my skin was significantly LESS oily in the morning.

I would run out and switch to another brand and started to notice a pattern. My skin was glowing and acne gone when I used the lapis oil. I started having some cystic acne this spring and thought it was diet, or hormones or dehydration. I was trying everything with no help. My chin and jawline was so congested. It dawned on me to purchase a big bottle of Lapis oil and give that a try before my next option of seeing a dermatologist. You guys!!! Within 4 days of using the Lapis oil again my sling completely cleared! My skin is glowing and all the congestion is gone!

I was so happy to see this product didn’t have pore-clogging polymers and silicones like most oil-free moisturizers do. Upon application, this lightweight oil had a pleasant scent and absorbed quickly and fully. Within DAYS of nightly use, I saw a huge improvement in the amount of inflammation and redness of my acne.

I kept reading reviews on the Lapis facial oil and ordered it in hopes it would help my pesky acne-prone skin. Boy and I happy I made the investment! Within a few days, my skin started to transform from decent to glowing. The Emerald oil was great for winter, but Ohio summers are hot. The Lapis is absolutely perfect from the scent all the way to how it cleared up my face. The longer I use it, the more I enjoy it! It's quite expensive, but with that said, a little bit goes a long way and this will last a long time.

I had one cropping up that I was treating mostly with epsom salt(highly effective) and other herbal tinctures/teas but I must say that after only using this product for about 5 days I notice a marked difference in my over all skin texture and that crazy cyst never came to a head and is nearly gone.

Around the time I hit 30, my skin FINALLY started to clear up, likely because of my use of tretinoin (retin-A) and spiro, prescribed by my dermatologist. About 6 months ago, everything went horribly wrong and I began having terrible breakouts. I tried SO many different products—masks, serums, toners, you name it. Absolutely nothing helped. I decided on a whim to try the blue tansy mask, and then this oil as well. Within a month my skin was COMPLETELY CLEAR, and has remained clear since then. The couple stray zits that cropped up diminished and disappeared within a day or two. I will never again go without these two products. Thank you Herbivore for saving my skin!

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2022-10-18,Worked for me when steroids didn't,"I developed eczema on my face during my second pregnancy. My baby was breeched, and I was in constant pain - a deep contrast to my first pregnancy. The breakout of eczema began on my chin in the second trimester and would come and go. After giving birth, the eczema took over and I looked like Darth Maul. The intense burning, dryness, and itching was unbearable. My dermatologist said she had no tricks up her sleeve except for a topical steroid and a month long dose of an antibiotic once I stopped breastfeeding. I used the steroid for about 6 months taking the breaks my Derm recommended. Unfortunately, my skin got so thin the eczema got worse and more painful. My eyes felt swollen. I discontinued use of the steroid for good (threw it in the trash) and went back to my routine of cetaphil face wash, then a zinc bar w emu oil, then this Phoenix oil. The eczema disappeared. So, with no steroid and no antibiotic, my skin is beautiful again. I don't even wear makeup on my skin directly. I fill in my brows and apply mascara and lip tint/moisturizer. I will never use a topical steroid again. It almost ruined my face. I will continue to purchase this facial oil and have even gifted it to my mother for her birthday.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2020-05-13,LITERALLY THE HOLY GRAIL,"I have never done a review for a product before, but I felt like I absolutely needed to do one for the Lapis Face Oil (I'm turning into that girl...hahaha). I have struggled with pretty bad cystic acne, with skin that is extremely dry, while also sometimes being oily. My skin couldn't make up it's mind if it's little pores depended on it. I feel like I have tried everything over the years, from cheap to expensive. I have spent a good part of my life trying out what works best for my skin. I started using this because I found a video that recommended the mask. Feeling hella lame about myself because my face looked like a big red mess (as per usual), I caved in and bought the smaller set just to try it out. Now ladies and gents, I have breakouts basically EVERY day. It has been probably years since I didn't get at least one new pimple a day or every other day. DAY ONE of using this product I noticed an immediate change in the way my skin felt and looked. I IMMEDIATELY stopped getting breakouts and didn't have another breakout for OVER A WEEK. My cystic pimples haven't come back since. I have had just a few pimples since I started this product about a month ago, but they actually go away and they aren't big angry ones. I know you're probably sitting there reading this, much like I did, thinking this is too good to be true. I certainly can't speak for everyone, because everyone's skin is different, but I will never be without this product ever again. I use this one in the morning, and I picked up the Emerald CBD Oil as well and I use that one at night (also a fantastic product). I have never felt this confident bout my skin. I almost left the house without make-up the other day....almost...I haven't even given that idea a thought since I was a freakin kid. My dudes, this is worth the money. I feel like the ingredients in this are quality and it really helped balance whatever the heck my skin was missing before.

I have dry, acne prone, slightly sensitive skin.  I like a good dewy, glowing look to my skin, and this oil delivers that glow 110%.  I like to put 2 drops on in the morning, and 4 drops at night for extra skin-loving moisture.   As always I LOVE that this product is fully vegan, cruelty free and made naturally.

Any time I wash my dog, he obsessively scratches afterward for days to a couple of weeks from dry skin. I've tried multiple products and nothing seemed to work. I was getting to the bottom of my Phoenix oil and thought to try it on my dog's skin to use it up.... it only took a few drops on the areas he was obsessively scratching and rubbing it in before he stopped within minutes. Keep in mind he was scratching so bad, he was leaving clumps of fur on the carpet and would scratch throughout the night. I felt so bad for him on top of waking me up constantly. It doesn't take much but applying it close to the skin and rubbing it in works like magic. Guess you can say the Phoenix oil is for the whole family! Some might say it's an expensive solution but a dozen or so drops is a lot cheaper than how much I was spending trying to find a solution.... plus a few drops is well worth my dog's comfort and my sleep.

I have combination, sensitive, textured, and acne-prone skin that I can usually control very well with diet. I had been using a good quality Jojoba oil and a couple different gentle cleansers for years with okay results but it wasn’t anything spectacular. I got a hormonal breakout all over my face and back after I had my daughter last year and ordered this lapis oil and the charcoal bar cleanser as I’d been looking at this brand for a while, and holy moly. Within days my skin started to clear up and look SO smooth, balanced, and soft, and my persistent redness and irritation just melted away. I didn’t review right away because I wanted to make sure it wasn’t a temporary initial reaction. I’ve now been using this combination for over a year and it’s still my holy grail! I’ve only purchased 2 bottles of the lapis (and I still have months left on my second bottle) which is pretty great for daily application for 14 months, so don’t be unnerved by the price. I recommend this to everyone I know and I’ve given samples to a few friends and my sister and they are all obsessed! 

Notes: I don’t use the lapis oil on my back, just on my face and neck. I do use the charcoal cleanser on both face and back.

Orchid was all right, I wasn‘t a huge fan of the smell. Phoenix was also nice, but my favorite was definitely Lapis. I have dry and really sensitive skin and it feels like it’s made for me. :)
With my old products I needed a serum, moisturizer cream and facial oil to keep my face hydrated. Now I only use Lapis and my face feels much softer, my skin looks so much healthier and it doesn’t look oily after applying it, like with my old products.
I have been using it now for a couple of days and I love it. It smells really nice too!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-09-15,Great for oily skin,I was Scared to use facial oil on my oily skin i thought i would Get more oily. But this product actually doesn’t make me as much oily as i was Without it. I love It! The prize is crazy but I’ll order more once i finish My little bottle.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-08-30,the holy grail for oily skin!,"I've been using this oil for about a year now and it's easily my favorite skincare product. I have oily skin but I know how important it is to not overdry it which is exactly where the lapis oil comes in. I use it on top of moisturizer because that's how I like to have it on, I prefer the extra dewy look on me. When wearing makeup, I use it on it's own because my skin just soaks it up to leave a nice glow that's not too oily underneath. My cousin has really oily skin, she's a teenager struggling with acne and this oil helped calm her skin down quite a bit. Now the only time she breaks out is during her period and she's super happy with it! Please keep making products like this!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-08-25,Best Skin Care Product I've Ever Used,"I've been using this for months now after I saw it in a youtube skin care routine. It has changed my skin more than any other product. 
I've always been prone to black heads and white heads that only seemed to get worse every time I moisturized. Physical exfoliants helped but I hated using them. I'm just not a fan of scrubbing my face. This oil has done more for preventing my blemishes than any other product ever has. It also has the added benefit of softening my skin better than a lotion. I just love it.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-08-23,Best thing ever,"I love this product so so much. I started breaking out and then decided to start using this product. It saved my skin! It is such a light alternative to moisturizer and I love it so much! I tried for a brief moment the glossier moisturizer and started breaking out again, came back to this and was fine. I would 100% recommend",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-08-15,WOW WOW WOW,"After two years of battling adult acne with just about everything I could get my hands on, seriously though, I spent wayyy too much money trying to get this crap under control. (I looked like a teenage boy at 25!) But I began to consistently incorporate this oil into my routine using it in the morning and night as my face was so inflamed. After four weeks of use (and basic skin care routine), my skin has completely changed, I still get little zits every once in a while but it is nothing compared to the thousands (ok that might be an exaggeration) but soo many zits that were cystic and painful! Thank you herbivore! I finally feel confident in my no makeup skin!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-08-12,Stop Wasting Your Money on Lotion!,"Ok.... here's the deal. I'm mostly writing this because I'm afraid that if they don't keep getting amazing (accurate) reviews they'll stop selling this product and THAT CANNOT HAPPEN! I buy a bottle every 6 months. For years I struggled with oily skin until I learned that actually means my skin is dry and therefore, overproducing oil. This keeps my skin hydrated but not oily. It absorbs and does not make me break out at all! I remember reading reviews a while back when I first tried the product that some people were struggling with breakouts or other bad reactions... with every product there are always going to be people who have skin that does not react well. You cannot compare your skin to someone else's. Request a sample and see if this works for you. If it does, it'll change your life like it did mine!!!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-07-29,Tears of joy!,"I’ve been struggling with fungal acne for almost 8 months now. I have an illness that throws off the PH in my body and in return causes me to break out. I switched up my whole routine to KBeauty products. I’ve been seeing an improvement, but not as much as I’d like. I decided to buy the Blue Tansy mask and I could not believe the results I received from just one use. Clearer, more even toned skin. I decided to stop being afraid of using facial oil on my combo/acne prone skin and try the lapis oil once and for all. I’ve been using it for 2 days and I cannot believe the improvement in my skin. I had a giant pimple on my cheek which was very inflamed as well as some fungal acne on my chin and forehead. They are almost completely gone! I woke up today in happy tears. If you struggle with acne you know the toll it can take on your self-esteem. This oil is my holy grail. There’s no way I’m even removing it from my skincare routine. I can’t wait to use it with the blue tansy mask tonight and see the results in the am. Thank you for creating the perfect product for me!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-06-19,MUST HAVE,"I have been using this oil religiously since the end of January. When I began using it in the mini clarify set, my skin was angry, irritated, and broken out. I immediately saw results specifically with this oil, prism, and the blue tansy mask. My breakouts cleared faster and the overall health of my skin was so much better. For the first time in my life, my skin glows! Through the past few months, if I stray from this oil, my skin freaks out. Lapis oil calms my skin like nothing else I’ve ever used. I still break out around my time of the month, but with this oil, my face is less red and irritated and my break outs heal more quickly. I will repurchase this product forever!! Thank you, Herbivore! 💙",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-06-16,MY SKIN SAVIOR,"MAGIC IN A BOTTLE!!! This face oil has completely transformed my skin and I will never use anything else again! I wanted an oil I could wear during the day that absorbed well so I could wear makeup on top. I was using Emerald but it was too oily for daytime use. These ingredients are puuuuure magic. I have sensitive, acne-prone, oily skin and this product has done wonders. It's calming, moisturizing and I truly believe it has even changed the texture/tone of my skin! Now I'm dying to try the mask that coincides with the oil... Don't question purchasing- do yourself a favor and buy!!! Your skin will thank you :)",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-05-04,My Favorite Facial Oil,"Lapis is hands down my favorite facial oil ever. I've not used any other facial oil that calm irritation and prevents acne. I love using this with the Blue Tansy mask. Whenever I am suffering from a hormonal breakout, I trust Lapis to save the day. This is a repurchase for me.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-04-28,YES PLEASE.....,I am in my mid 40’s and I tried a sample of this oil and woke up the next morning with such soft skin. It’s not greasy unless you overdo it. It absorbs well. I prefer to use it at night and wake up to bright and soft skin. I really do love it. This and vintners daughter are my favorites. Try it!!!!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-04-10,great for hormonal acne!,"i purchase the trial size version before investing. I have been so happy with how my skin has improved after using this product for about 3 months. I have combination skin, but I struggle with terrible hormonal acne and I always breakout around that time of the month. I use the lapis oil nightly in combination with the prism glow potion. I have had noticeably less breakouts and my skin feels soft, moisturizer, and more even in tone. A bit heavy for day time wear but great as part of your evening ritual!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-03-05,Life changing,"I have very oily skin, so I was excited to use this because I’ve heard amazing things!! I was a little thrown at first because when I first applied it, it felt very oily, and not in a way that you want your skin oils to feel. It had the same feel on my skin when I don’t moisturize enough and I overproduce my natural oils. However, after letting it soak into the skin for about 5 minutes it felt so so so good.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-02-28,Love!,I use this at night with Prism. It is very soothing and smells that way too!

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-02-12,What is this magic?,"I got a small sample of this and I have used it for one day (once at night and once in the morning) and my skin looks better than it has in months! I am in total shock! My acne is less inflamed and irritated and my skin looks so smooth. This is the most amazing product I have ever used on my face. Run, don’t walk, to buy this.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-02-06,Mariah Carey obsessed!!!,"Not to be cheesy, but to be cheesy. This product is amazing and the perfect compliment to the blue tansy mask. I had only used this for a week until I experienced frantic results as far as evening out my skin tone, reducing my acne to nothing and giving me an overall wonderful completion. Will be buying again and highly recommend for all skin types if used consistently with another product (blue tansy mask) to see best results.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-02-02,Amazing,"I never write reviews, but this calls for it ! This stuff is amazing almost so I kinda don’t wanna let the secrect of how amazing it is out ! At first I was afraid to use it on my already oily, hormonal acne prone skin. Took me about a month to use it but I finally took the leap ...soooo glad I did. I have been using lapis oil ( daily) along with the blue tansy mask( twice a week) , retinol a rx strength( every 3 days ) , a good moisturizer( daily ) and a at home micro needling kit( 3 times a week) And my skin has totally done a 360. Before I was having breakouts daily, multiple cystic acne spots . Now I maybe have 1-2 blackheads pop up a week and I spot treat them with lapis or the mask and they are gone the next morning. I cannot rave enough about this product. The price it totally worth it if it means I can go acne free !",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-01-30,Great Gift!,"I received this as a Christmas 2017 gift and started using it about six months later when my usual face cream ran out. Whereas many face creams just sit on my face, the Lapis absorbs wonderfully and helps my complexion look more even. Moreover, many face creams will cause irritation and tearing if I happen to rub a bit of it near my eyes, but I have not had this problem with Lapis. Now that I am nearing the end of the bottle, I'll be buying myself some more. One note: the dropper has stopped working recently.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-01-29,Your skin will Thank You,"This oil left my skin very happy! I recommend only 2 drops and firmly press, but make sure your skin is clean prior to applying! This oil helped my dry nose area, for the couple times i was able to use it until it perished at the airport in the womens restroom. Such a sad moment, as it was still a full bottle! This oild goes a long way! Wrap it up some plastic wrap to protect it in case it slips or drops on the floor so your investment wont go to waste.",,,,

It makes my skin feel amazing and I just realized I should have been us8ng it 2 times a day and I started that 6 months ago and WOW.

Instead of breaking out and so congested with blackheads like usual, my skin absorbed the oil right at first touch and stayed hydrated without turning into an oil pan throughout the day. Even when I returned to my home town which was thoroughly humid and hot and dusty, my skin still absorbed Lapis Oil and stayed fresh for an entire day. Love love love!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2019-01-05,This oil changed my life,"I wish I took a photo of my skin before I started using this oil, my face has been a real struggle for me for the past 12 months and I've been dealing with hormonal acne and that would result in scarring. It has really effected my confidence and made me feel super insecure. This oil has cleared my skin up and faded a huge dark spot I had on my forehead. I'm so happy and have started feeling like my old self again. I can't recommend this product enough or this company they are so efficient and kind and I'm only buying my skin care from herbivore from now on!",,,,

I've struggled a lot with hormonal acne and have never had much luck finding products that work- my skin is extremely sensitive and becomes red or itchy with most acne products. This stuff REALLY works. I started with the sample size bottle and was hooked. My skin was more even, less dry, and I noticed that my acne was not as severe. Unfortunately, the top came lose when I was traveling and the entire bottle leaked into my bag (it didn't stain!!). I haven't been able to repurchase yet, but I dream of it! Highly recommend!!",,,,

I've tried just about everything here and here is my review for:

Lapis: This and the Blue Tansy work REALLY well together! I was very impressed how fast the results were. It sounded too good to be true when I spoke to other people about this product in the past as it is always sold out. I have had this product for now 3 years. It works really well with breakouts and have heard friends say it works with acne scarring as well. Highly recommend!!",,,,

I've been using the Phoenix oil with the Bakuchiol Retinol Alternative serum for years so this new product seemed like  a natural to try. I just love it - the wrinkle smoothing effect of the Moon Fruit  is amazing. The Moon Dew eye cream is phenomenal. I've tried so many eye products through the years and worked in the cosmetic industry for several years as well. I tried many very expensive products that were not nearly as effective as this cream! If you are thinking about trying these new products - do it! The price on this set is phenomenal as well.

The lovely serum , (A little goes a long way! As with all of these products ) texture is smooth and somewhat creamy, but thin enough to absorb very quickly. There is the slight (and I do mean slight) tackiness as to be expected. Feels so soft touching the skin …

The eye cream , is velvety and very moisturizing. ( I have serious dry eyes that do require a bit extreme on moisturizing so I did add another product, however this would be great on perhaps less mature skin) 
Last but not least the oil… oh … dear aunt giddy… if you purchase one thing out of this set, ( again the entire set is wonderful)  it’s the oil. 
It’s very light , doesn’t leave a greasy after feel, and makes my skin feel luxurious! 

All these products have a wonderful scent. As far as effectiveness of them. Moisturizing is always good practice . As well as the assisting cell turnover. However, I can’t say that this has upped my skin game . I can say it’s a perfect maintenance set. Again, I’m 38 and have had some life that left it’s love kisses on areas of my face lol

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/skin-in-the-clouds-plumping-hydration-set,4,2022-12-31,Overall Decent Product,"Packaging : 5/5 stunning appearance.

Effectiveness : 4/5 Skin felt mostly soft and hydrated, a little sticky after using the serum but it goes away after a few minutes.

Smell : 2/5 both the serum and the crème have an odd smell, almost like latex? It smells like rose water and latex basically and it’s pretty off putting considering the smell lasts for like 4 hours. 

Final Thoughts: While I do love the formula of the products, I don’t think I will purchase again because the smell is so off putting to me. Maybe it’s just me ? If you can get past the smell then I definitely recommend this product to give you a hydration boost.

I loved that serum BUT it also made my skin pill. It drove me crazy so I thought this might be better. I hate oily feeling things and I was hoping this would not leave my skin feeling too much that way, but it does. I also wear glasses so my face just feels like an oily mess when using. I think it did decent at moisturizing so I don’t want to give it too bad of a review, it’s just really the oily feeling I can’t stand. 

Also - I am taking “accutane” or isotretinoin right now. 30 mg twice a day currently. Iykyk. I’ve never had to deal with dry skin before but it is critical to find some good products to stave off the dryness with this medication.

Also, because I have olive-toned skin, I think the cool-toned green of the oil gave my pallor a sickly, gray-green look. That may not make any sense, and maybe it's the winter, but I do know that I started disliking my complexion after using this oil (and I incorporate new things into my routine one at a time, this is the suspected cause). I'd look into the mirror, make a face, and think, ""Why do I look sick?"" Even though I use the recommended amount of oil, I think the initial overlay of that cool-toned green interacts with my skin in an unkind way. I switched from a different oil that made my skin glow, but I thought, ""I've just put an oil on, of course my skin is glowing."" When I saw this touted hydration and a glow I jumped on it, but I'll be returning to that previous serum because, wow, after leaving it behind I realized it really did make my skin warm and oof!

I have acne prone skin but it isn’t very oil, in fact it has been getting drier as I age so clean moisture and hydration is important to me, but this did fee like it didn’t penetrate well either so I don’t know! What works for some doesn’t work for others I guess. Not even sure I can exchange.",,,,

The price is a little steep for me so I was really on the fence about trying this product. With the great reviews and amazing ingredients I finally had to try it. I have sensitive redness prone and acne prone skin. I am always looking for brighter less red skin and hoped this would be my golden ticket but my skin did not like it. It made it more red and blotchy. It looked like I had tiny little red dots everywhere accentuating my pores which is not normal for me. I tried it with and without the cloud cream. Still my favorite packaging of any company out there. Wish I could give it 5 ⭐️ .,,,,

I’m a huge fan and have been satisfied by every purchase; except this one. This oil sort of sits on my skin and is not as easily absorbed as the others. Also, my face had the worst reaction: red bumps everywhere and tenderness. At first I thought it was a general breakout but then I began to notice by the end of the night how the reaction would subside. I woke up with a clear face one morning then put this on after cleansing and boom right away my skin flares up. I wish we could post pics with our reviews! Even worse I can’t return this item because i bought it with the amethyst scrub “New Gems” package and I enjoyed the scrub so Herbivore won’t refund me because I can’t return both. On you guys’ end that needs to be worked on, especially if the product gave me such an awful reaction you should accomadate me. It’s not like I just didn’t like the smell or something, this product caused me actual physical and emotional harm, being that I don’t wear makeup, I had to scramble to purchase concealer and stuff to cover the reaction so I could look presentable for my work.. I will also say I don’t have extremely dry or oily or sensitive skin. I’m 23 and have really nice skin, don’t suffer from acne and eat/live healthy. I’m not allergic to anything either. Anyways, after about a week my skin is back to normal and I’m using Lapis and Orchid as usual. This oil is all hype!!!!!",,,,

It absorbs so smoothly and flawlessly into skin, the packaging is beautiful, the smell is divine and the company’s goals for clean skin care are amazing. However, I used this daily for about 5 days and then noticed I was getting really bad breakouts. I am not acne prone, nor do I have oily skin. If anything I have extremely dry skin. I thought the breakouts might be caused by something else, but stopped using the oil for about 3 weeks. When I used it again this past week I again broke out and I only used it once!

At that level of usage, I'm buying a bottle every 2 months, which feels like a lot/pretty expensive. Just something to keep in mind-- I LOVE Herbivore, but there are definitely other facial mists out there that are more affordable and will likely give you similar if not identical results.

My skin is reactive so I have a very simple routine and this oil didn’t break me out or cause any reaction. I use it morning and night, morning I use it under sunscreen. I notice a difference, my skin is very smooth with a natural glow. I don’t have to wear any makeup, my skin looks great without it.

She bought the Orchid Oil for me last Christmas and true to her beliefs I did indeed buy again. I love this product and even purchased the smaller sample sizes for traveling. I love the way it makes my skin feel and the scent is soft and subtle. I remain a repeat buyer for certain!,,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-08-04,Heaven Scent,Love the floral smell of this product - what drew me in first. Had seen this brand in San Francisco but made this purchase while in Seattle - later found it was from there. Also liked the product on my skin and so decided to expand my experience of the range - and purchased this again along with the other oils - but this is still by far my favorite. FYI my skin type is Oily/Como/ Senistive/ Dry/ Etc.... yes even though I am 50 it is still a bit of everything from one day to another. Enjoy.,,,,

I use it 2-3 times a week, along with my moisturizer when I want extra hydration. It feels really good on my face, not too heavy and doesn't make me break out. When I apply it, I pay extra attention to my eye area and cheek bones because of the oil's youth preserving qualities. Highly recommend- but be prepared for the scent-it's like walking through a butterfly garden or something...in a good way.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-03-09,A new lease on life (at least through skincare),"After years of fluctuating beauty routines, I was drawn to the idea of all natural beauty products. My skin has never consistently responded to moisturizers- I always end up with dry patches or all over oiliness. In my quest to ditch the chemicals and research brands with all natural ingredients, I one day came across Herbivore. After months of obsessing over the brand, I finally decided to take a chance on the Orchid Facial Oil mini. After a couple months of using this oil, I've become a fan for life. After only a few days, I noticed a difference in the wrinkles near my eyebrows- the creases have nearly disappeared. My skintone is much more even where I previously had dark patches and acne scars. The smell is fantastic, too. I love that I can recognize and pronounce every ingredient and feel good about what I'm putting on my face. Can't wait to try out more from this line!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-03-03,Glowing!!!,I love this oil. I started getting compliments on how glowing my skin looked immediately after starting it. I use it morning and night and love the subtle fragrance. Obsessed!,,,,

My skin is softer, more hydrated and my acne has subsided significantly! Plus, it smells amazing. Will definitely be repurchasing this larger bottle when my mini one is done!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-02-09,Cannot live without this,"I have been using Ochid Oil over a year now. I LOVE this newer packaging because the previous roller application was kind of annoying. So thank you Herbivore Babes!!!!! -Now- this stuff is amazing *_* I use it only after cleansing every day, morning and night; I dont cleanse at night religiously, though. I’ve noticed a major difference in my skin and consistency with this product. I used to suffer from bad hormonal acne on my chin and jawline and forehead bumps that weren’t pimples just weird bumps. Even when I wasn’t using toner or masks or even a regular moisturizer in my routine, orchid oil kept my skin clear, glowing and happy. The smell is beautiful as well, I never get sick of it and you don’t notice it after it’s all absorbed in and you go on with your day. A few drops like 5-6 is perfect for me. It doesn’t sit on your face all greasy. It leaves it soo soft but dewy. I usually go through 1 of these of a month, at times faster. I plan on getting the larger size from now on since I will be enjoying this product foreverrrr",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-01-27,Love love love,Great product! I use the Lapis oil everyday for my combo skin. I loved it so much I decided to try the Orchid oil. I love this one too!!! I apply the Orchid oil under my eyes and on my lips and decolate where and the Lapis oil everywhere else. Or I use the Orchid oil all over at night when my skin is calm and not inflamed or irritated. This stuff smells divine too!! It’s also great for the ends of my hair.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-01-15,So happy with this brand,"I bought Orchid oil as a Christmas gift for my mom. I had smelled the oil before and felt the texture, both which were absolutely stunning, so I thought this might be the right one for her. She's not really an oil person but she told me she really loves Orchid and would possibly even buy another when her's is done! I was so delighted at this. Orchid is light enough to wear during the day as it's not greasy or heavy. The jasmine scent is intoxicating, which is plus!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-12-09,Far exceeds oils/creams 4x its price it's perfect!,"I'm 24 and had never washed my skin before trying Herbivore just under a year ago; I've since experimented with a few other clean brands for fun – all of which were far more expensive – but none felt nearly as luxurious as Herbivore's products. They all made my pours too large or irritated my skin, which is otherwise clear (hence why I'd never used products on my face)

The Orchid oil is absolutely among my favorite products (along with the brightening, clay, and tansy masks as well as the coco rose body polish). The smell is calming and when I apply it at night both my skin and my mind wake up feeling clean and calm .

My only request is to be able to order the orchid roller on its own (honestly, I would probably order one to keep in my bathroom, one for my purse, and one for my gym bag or car), but the roller only comes in a trial set (the trial set was my first purchase – highly recommend!) or oil set. This mini is packaged with a dropper like the larger oils, which is nice in its own right. But the roller is perfect on the go as it offers a bit more control than the dropper.

This is the first review I've ever written and can't rave enough about herbivore's products, but I hope they'll make individual rollers available for purchase!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-12-03,Beautiful skin product!,"I started out using the blue Lapis oil to deal with some hormonal breakouts, but my skin os typically on the dry side and I'm > 40 so I wanted to try the Orchid oil in my regular rotation. Turns out it's the best product I've added to my regimen in years -- instant glow and softness, none of the oil-slick residue I've found with other high-priced skin oils. It's perfect, and I know the ingredients are pure, so it's officially my new favourite product! I use it before bed and in the am under sunscreen. Will definitely buy the full size once I run out!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-12-02,Heavenly!,"This oil smells and feels heavenly.

I wasn't sure how I would feel about using an oil like this, but it left my skin so hydrated and I could see a glow and a difference right away! I read about using facial oil along with a self facial massage to reduce wrinkles (natural botox!) and felt that within a few days of doing that with the Orchid oil, I could definitely see a difference! I'm now addicted to oils, and cannot ever picture myself going back to my old moisturizer ways ;)",,,,

Always a treat!,"I purchased this about 6 months ago and am 3/4's done with the tiny bottle (I switch back and forth between my normal moisturizer and this). I love the smell and every time I use it, my skin looks a lot more moisturized and I feel like I have a glow. I use it both day and night and love how soft my skin feels after having used it. Because my skin feels fully moisturized after using it, it makes my makeup go on smoother and look more natural, at least to me. It's my favorite Herbivore product and I just purchased the full size.",,,,

I bought the three pack of the facial oils and this one is by far my favorite. I definitely have noticed my skin looking brighter when using this one in particular. Perfect for everyday or switch it up with other oils throughout the week. I'll use this with the Moon Fruit mask as well and what a powerful combo. Highly recommend if you're really into brightening serums. Can't beat the price, way less expensive than a lot of other things out there and equally if not more effective.",,,,

I have tried numerous other facial oils & Herbivore is very different. These oils sink in to your skin quickly, don't just sit on top. They are not greasy at all so you can actually wear them under make-up. Very moisturizing & brightening, but doesn't clog pores.
I work 12+ hour shifts & my make-up often ""dries out"" or wears off by the end of the day. I find my make-up looks much fresher for much longer, and also lasts longer when using Orchid in the morning. And of course it smells amazing!",,,,

I use it daily, and it keeps my skin moisturized all day. My skin is very dry, and I have to exfoliate daily. Orchid doesn't irritate my skin at all. How amazing it smells (very strongly of jasmine) made me want to rub it all over my body, so I got the jasmine body oil, too. I love Orchid and I will absolutely be repurchasing when I run out! I love it so much I also got Phoenix.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-12-18,In love,"It's official. I'm never ever going to stop using this oil. I was crazy skeptical about using any kind of oil on my face since I have oily skin. I thought it was just going to make it worse, but turns out it stops my skin from overproducing oil since I'm replenishing it with the oil in the morning and night. I use three pumps during the day and simply use a mattifying powder to get rid of the glow. But if you have super dry skin, you won't need to use powder. I also use about ten pumps at night to spoil myself before bed. It feels so incredibly luxurious.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-11-13,The best moisturizer my face has ever met,I had found that products with unnatural added fragrances and perfumes really irritated my skin and at first I tried the mini sample because I have never committed to a facial moisturizer in my life due to my sensitivity. I noticed the all natural ingredients really started working harmoniously with my skin along with the pleasurable light sent of jasmine and the smooth and silky feeling it left on my face! Over the past 3 months I have noticed a huge difference in my skins texture (no more bumps and breakouts) and the impressive hold of moisture throughout a whole day !! I'd say that herbivore has definitely changed my perspective on beauty products and made my routine into a ritual!,,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/orchid-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-07-05,INCREDIBLE.,"This oil is incredible.

For years, I have tried to get on the facial oil trend, but never really found one that I liked. I had bought a few other products from Herbivore before and really loved them, and wanted to give this oil a try.

About my skin: acne prone (the ugly, under the skin cystic type), relatively sensitive, very fair, combination in terms of oiliness. I have dry patches as well as some discoloration because of old acne, and sun spots.

I only bought the travel-sized roll on of the Orchid oil, and I wish I had bought the full size. This stuff is so nice - it smells AMAZING, and I have been using it both during the day and at night. It's replaced my day time moisturizer, and it absorbs beautifully. I layer my sunscreen over it and everything sits very well, and my makeup applies flawlessly. I've never felt greasy or oily, and nothing slides around. My skin looks clear, hydrated, and happy - I have definitely noticed a difference, especially in the morning when I wake up. 

I am absolutely in love with this product and will definitely be purchasing the full sized bottle. While it is pricey, I believe it is worth every penny!

Thank you, Herbivore, for making natural, luxurious products that make my skin beautiful, that smell lovely, and that work!",,,,

I've been dealing with it for months now, and haven't really done anything about it except avoid touching it. While that helped it heal, it wouldn't be enough to fade the spot. 

I started using the Orchid oil and noticed results within days! The spot is significantly fading and its dry patch seems to be getting smaller and smaller. I then began using the oil all over my face in place of moisturizer and it gives my skin a beautiful matte texture and subtle glow! I will definitely be purchasing a full size in the future :)",,,,

The smell of this oil is heaven. I'm normally not a floral scent enthusiast but this smells like jasmine green tea and I adore it. If the smell worries you - it dissipates quickly.

The smell is terrible - it literally smells like a sharpie. I wish it smelled better because it does a great job of hydrating and made my skin soft. Like baby butt soft.

I guess a lot of people like the smell of this though, so maybe it's just me? Or maybe I received a bad batch scent wise. On the the bright side the scent faded away after it soaked in.

Will I repurchase? Probably not. I would be thrilled though if they made this formula in a different scent like lilac or jasmine (assuming it smelled accurate)",,25-34,Dry,"Anti-aging, Dullness, Dryness"

I gave the product three stars because it was lovely at first, and the packaging is divine, but if it doest last more than a couple months it's not very price effective.

She noticed that it was making her skin itch and burn, but she has very sensitive skin so she gave it to me. I definitely do not have sensitive skin, so I layered this oil atop my A313 balm without testing it first. The first 30 minutes were fine and I was enjoying the slightly thicker texture of this oil compared to the Lapis. By the time I went to bed, I was noticing some light tingling near my under-eyes but it wasn’t uncomfortable. I awoke an hour later with my face absolutly on fire with burning and itching! Luckily there was no visible rash on my skin, so I washed my face and applied an anti-itch gel. I can’t imagine what could have caused such a reaction apart from perhaps an allergy to orchid? I googled similar reactions and saw nothing, so maybe it was just a weird genetic disposition to orchid. Proceed with caution using this one, and test a small area first!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/mini-bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-smoothing-serum,5,2019-10-25,Beautiful Serum,"I'm 35 with dry skin and I can never get through the retinol ""purge"". I've tried so many retinol products that everyone else loves, and my skin still flakes for weeks. Can't do it. After researching, I came upon this. I was extremely skeptical because I'm very picky and thorough when it comes to skin care, but after understanding the ingredients I went for it. I didn't see anything until I used it for a month, and I am happy with the results I've achieved since then. My skin is brighter, tighter and just more fresh looking. With nearly all skincare treatments, please stick it out to see results! It doesn't do a ton in terms of hydration for my dry skin on it's own, but paired with my other hydrating products every little bit helps. I like the watery and VERY SLIGHTLY sticky texture, it sinks in quickly and spreads beautifully. I'm not here to tell you it's a miracle, but it definitely improved my skin and I've repurchased 3 times. If you have trouble with retinols like I do, I really believe you should give this a try (and give it a little time!)",,,,

It's perfectly subtle, goes on easily, and after about a month my skin looks a lot brighter and like I went through a transformation. At 43 but still with oily skin but worried about wrinkles, this is the PERFECT potion for my crazy skin. The one thing I would want to let others know is, the texture is not like a typical serum and it took some getting used to, but I got accustomed to it after a few times.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/mini-bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-smoothing-serum,5,2019-09-30,The BEST!,"This is my first time writing a review for a skincare product! I am 28 and have an oily skin when I'm in a humid environment, recently I moved to California and my skin started to break out. It was so dry! also I used to have some fungal acne on my forehead, and I can only use aloe vera gel to moisturize it. 

I have been treating my face by mixing aloe vera gel and squalene oil, my face was better but the dryness is still there. I tried the spinach+kale moisturizer from YTP, but it didn't help much. Anyway, one day I bought Bakuchiol from Sephora to try it out just because I love all the ingredients. 

The result was incredible! I use rose face mist right after the shower, and then apply this bouncy, jelly-water-based Bakuchiol all over my face. I tried only this serum without any moisturizer to see how I feel. My skin is even, smooth and brighter! I don't feel any dryness ever again. I used to have some acne too, especially before my period, but this month I have just some tiny acne spots, I don't know if it is because of this, but I would give credit to it too.

It was so hard to find a product that is clean and water-based without chemical ingredient. Many thanks to Herbivore! I will continue buying this product. Please never ever stop producing this Bakuchiol. It is the best!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/mini-bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-smoothing-serum,5,2019-09-25,Way Better than Retinol/oids,"I'm a 26 year old man who was using a retinoid (2% in squalene from the ordinary) for about two months. I saw 0 results, and it stressed my skin out to the point where it was irritated, bumpy with tons of pimples just below the skin, and sensitive to the touch, even with an spf 25 I was using. I used it correctly, only at night every 3 days or so at first, then gradually worked up to every other night, then every night. I have sensitive skin and I read all about the ""purge"" that comes with retinol so I stuck with it to see if it worked - it didn't.

I did a lot of research into retinoid alternatives and found Herbivore's Bakuchiol serum and picked one up at Sephora and literally noticed results the next day. My skin was softer and less irritated and bumpy. It's been almost a month now and my skin looks incredible. The bumps are gone, my skin is softer and plumper and has a really healthy glow to it. I use it every evening after washing with cold water and before Aesop's Camellia nut cream (good for sensitive skin), and in the morning I use a touch of diluted apple cider vinegar followed by Aesop's Avail spf moisturizer.

I am 30 years old and have pale, redness prone, rough textured, dry, sensitive skin that I've been working to find a reliable routine/remedy for a few years now and a think this is the one!

This gently reduces lines and my redness from acne marks or irritation is greatly reduced by morning and being close to eliminated in just 3 weeks of use. I like to layer Lapis (blue tansy) over it which is another HG acne / redness reducer. My 41 yo skin is hydrated, plump, and glowy.

It took around 6-8 weeks to see real results, but now that I see them, it is amazing! I have very sensitive, rosacea skin and cannot use traditional retinol products, or AHAs and BHAs. This did not irritate my skin at all. It took a bit of time to see results because it is so gentle and since I take great care of my skin, it's already in good condition. But now all the dullness is completely gone and there is an added firmness and bounce. This is now a part of my permanent routine, replacing a copper serum I had been using previously. Even though I was given a tester bottle, this is an honest review and I love it!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/mini-bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-smoothing-serum,5,2019-08-23,great alternative to Retinol,"I saw a facialist for the first time in April because I was having bad hormonal breakouts from a BC switch. The facialist said my skin was getting too think from using Retinol ( Tretinoin 0.05% cream). I also hate how in the summer it makes my skin burn so easily, and I was wondering if that was doing more harm than good.I decided to stop using the prescription stuff for the summer. I saw this at Sephora a few months later. 
 I have been using this product for 5 weeks. I don't know if I have noticed any difference in lines or hyperpigmentation, but I definitely feel a difference in my acne in that I don't have any! Normally around my period time I get zits and the frustrating thing is for me now that I am in my 30s a zit leaves a red/dark mark on my face for quite awhile, even if I don't mess with it, so getting one is bad news! My skin has been really clear ever since I started using this. I thought for sure I wold still breakout at that time of month, and I felt a zit coming on my chin, but then it just disappeared before it could get to the surface! I use this every night after I shower, with a few drops of facial oil. I don't think I will get back on prescription retinol if this continues to perform! Great job Herbivore!",,,,

I was a devout prescription retinol user for many years, as it was the only thing that would control my adult acne. Now that I’ve been off it and pregnant or breastfeeding for most of the last three years, my skin has been a mess with all the hormonal changes. But I may be forever converted to this product as my skin went from horribly broken out around my jawline to completely clear within a week, and mostly after the first use. And without harsh side effects of retinol! I’ve never experienced such dramatic result from a product and I’ve tried everything. Ordered several more products from Herbivore since!",,,,

I use it morning and night, and the thing I love most about it is that you can use it with pretty much any other product, which unfortunately is not the case with retinol. I use it after a vitamin C serum in the morning, and I use it with my prescription alezaic acid gel at night, and I’ve had not problems with these ingredients mixing. I’m 30, and I have some lines on my forehead that are becoming somewhat deep-set that have been bothering me for months. Since I have started using this, my skin is much plumper, so those lines have really smoothed out. I seriously could not be more impressed with this serum.

I typically apply the serum after cleansing and put a light layer of face oil over it (my facial routine is very simple...)

I put two drops on before either the CBD or Lapis oil, and my skin over the past week has not stopped improving. I don't have fine lines or anything yet but the texture and tone has really blown me away. As a result the redness has decreased, and I can honestly say my pores have never looked smaller.

Disclaimer - I have never used a retinol continuously but I was prescribed it for acne SEVERAL years ago. I used to use it as spot treatment so I know how harsh it can be on your skin (but ultimately effective). Anyhow, this stuff is nothing like that. The consistency is like aloe and a little goes a long way. Careful to avoid the eye area. I use it after toning and under another serum (not Herbivore) and then put Lapis Oil over it. My skin looks incredibly clear and radiant. I am truly surprised that in a week's time I have such awesome results. Lets hope they keep up.

It took me a year to manage my horrible cystic acne & redness, but the scars stayed and even if i wasn't breaking out, I had red and brown acne scars all over my cheeks & chin. On top of that, i'm prone to very intense skin texture. I get small colorless bumps all over my face. I started using this once a day, and the first thing I noticed was how gentle and hydrating it was compared to a traditional retinol. In a month and a half, my acne scars have been drastically reduced AND all my texture dissapeared. It's so powerful, but so non-irritating, and since it's so lightweight and absorbs so fast, it layers great under other products and makeup. But, my biggest concern is how little there is for the price you pay. Although it's practically magic in a bottle, please know this full-size bottle will last you only a month if you use it nightly/daily. Other than that though, it's a miracle. Amazing for all skin types, though I personally have extreme combination (super oily t-zone, super dry cheeks & chin) and sensitive skin.",,,,

It also did not noticeably break me out at all. I can't really tell if any fine lines have disappeared from it but it seems to be a nice additive to my day AND night skin routine. The smell is pleasant, I love that there is no added dyes or fragrances to it as I refuse to use products that have either of those two things unnecessarily added. It is slightly slimy but I have learned to love it only because it does not tighten my skin the way the usual serum does. 

If you all are looking to see if it works I suggest you try a sample size of it to see if it works for you since the price is pretty steep. Not sure if I will repurchase but I am satisfied with using it for now.

It has a faint scent to it, and leaves my skin only a tiny bit sticky, and not shiny. The bottle is a cute yet sturdy size, and the dropper is nice too. I feel fancy just using it!
Cons: My skin is irritated! I noticed I get tiny acne on my jawline and cheekbone. And it somewhat burns my cheeks.. eek! it's not bad, but unpleasant. It is pricey, however it is worth it because of the good stuff in the ingredient list.

Note: I am 26, so I can't really tell if it's helping with any wrinkles because I don't have any yet lol.
I also read in one of the lower-rated reviews, that someone else had irritation, and it was supposedly the bakuchiol. Their dermatologist said that the skin needs to adjust to the bakuchiol, and recommended applying it once a week. I'm gonna try that, see if my skin adjusts to it for the next few weeks.

After seeing my dermatologist he explained that uses of retinols of any kind (plant or not) will cause this reaction to people with eczema prone skin. I am an eczema prone person. I could imagine this doing wonders on regular skin, but I want those who have skin conditions to do spot tests for longer than a week to avoid what I am enduring.

I have a big issue with bakuchiol being marketed as the ""more accessible and ethical"" retinol alternative. It's not good for human skin. And herbivore is not the first to be using it. It's been around for years and fell out of popularity because it's so harsh on so many people's skin. I got this as a free sample and I really did my best to give this product a shot given the reviews and seeing the buzz on their social media. Every time I tried to go back to it, using it on small test areas as always, it gives me super deep pressure zits that dont go away for days. The texture isn't exactly pleasing either, it's a sticky gel that doesn't even come out of the dropper well enough. I just don't understand why it has to be like that, sticky and uncomfortable, when other bakuchiol products aren't formulated like that? I tried it half a dozen times trying to give it a chance. I ended up throwing this product away (it was free + I recycled the glass don't @ me) because there is no one I would want to give it to, in fear of the same issues happening to them. There should really be more caution surrounding retinol-like products like this, and this one is EXPENSIVE. They are extremely harsh on the skin and are not for everyone. Plus this one is a really unsatisfying texture. I would have been even more disappointed if I had paid for this pricey product. Be cautious everyone. Try to get that free sample instead.",,,,

Iam in love with every single serum and oils in this box! I am so in love with the fact that they are harsh chemical free and just wholesome good ingredients. Our skin is the biggest organ on our body and whatever we put on it goes into our system so I'm rest assured with Herbivore products. I specially love Phoniex it's just that anti aging goodness about it. The best thing is with this box you can mix the serums and oils together customer create a serum. I found the most perfect way to apply the serums and oils without being too much. After cleaning and toning the skin place a few drops of Buckcholi and mix it with equal parts Prim...apply... then use 1 drop of emerald (unless rly dry then 2) 2 drops lapis and multiple drops of Phoniex( to your liking..I use this one the most). I personally follow up with a cream after the herbivore has absorbed some. LOVE IT! GET IT! YOU WONT REGRET IT!

I love how it lathers and feels on my face. The smell is not great, kind of chemically but that’s fine. However, when I try a new product, I always try to be honest with myself. I really wanted to like this wash but every time I used it, after only 2 days, I noticed small breakouts all over my face. So I’ve been doing my aloe rinse and also leaving natural aloe on my skin, and it clears up in 3 days. They give you a good amount because I still have a little over 3/4 of the bottle left but no need for it. It’s the only reason I’ve broken out these past few months.

I got a deluxe sample of their Emerald oil from Sephora and I was immediately smitten.  I was eager to try out the other oils in their lineup and this mini size kit of oils was the perfect chance. I’ve purchased three of these sets because I like the idea of having small sized vials.

My skin is somewhat sensitive but none of these oils have cause any irritation.  I have combination skin that leans dry. The Phoenix oil is the most replenishing and provides the deepest moisture. Lapis and Orchid are lighter oils. All do a great job in moisturizing.  I use about four to six drops to throughly cover my face. The oil supply effortlessly and oh so dreamy. None of the oils are heavily scented… Orchid has a very light fragrance but nothing that is overpowering. I love how these products make my skin feel.

Phoenix: Doesn't seem to calm my redness as much as I would like, but it does seem to be helping a little and I appreciate that it's not too horribly greasy feeling.  
Lapis: Ironically, this seems to clog my pores and cause whiteheads, which is the opposite of its intended  purpose of being a skin clarifier.  The smell is divine though.
Orchid:  This one is a bit on the oily side, so I am only using it at night.  I love the smell and it seems to be doing a good job so far if increasing my skin's hydration.

I have fallen in love with Lapis and am kicking myself for wanting a full size despite its high price point. In using it alongside the Prism serum and mask, I've noticed less oil production and smaller, clearer pores. I'm still playing around with Phoenix and Orchid - they seem to target the same skin problems and aren't really relevant to my skin right now. Despite that, I love the natural scents of these oils, how soft they are, and how quickly they absorb into the skin.

As typical, these face oils  left my dry/sensitive skin chapped, patchy and slightly itchy.  The oil just sits on top of my skin, doesn't absorb in.  The effect is deprives my skin of oxygen and leads to dehydration.  I didn't try Lapis after the poor results of the other two and have returned the products.  Orchid has WAY too strong a floral fragrance for my taste.  Loved the slightly citrus smell of Phoenix, but that was all.  These may work well for some skins types, but not mine.

After making it through my teen years with clear skin, I developed horrible cystic acne in my early twenties(thanks birth control).I’ve been on literally every product for troubled skin, including proactive and accuntane. These things helped clear my skin up, but in the end led to my current struggle with rosacea and eczema. Lapis oil is the answer! After a recent breakout of dry peeling red bumps all over my nose and cheeks(rosacea babes holla!) I bought the sample size and within a week my skin was clear. I have been to countless dermatologists trying to get to the bottom of my skin issues and nothing has helped as much as this simple, delightful oil. What is it?!? Unicorn tears?!?! It’s pure magic and if it ever gets discontinued I will freak the f*ck out....thank you for creating perfection herbivore!!!!!(also please create the perfect cleansing oil...

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-09-27,Liquid Gold,"Guys...buy it. Just do it. 

I have Hispanic olive toned skin so it’s oily. I have PTSD so I have high levels of cortisol/stress therefore I’ve been newly blessed with hormonally imbalanced cystic acne. 
Another thing I’m not too excited to share, is that I have Dermatillomania or Excoriation Disorder. If you don’t know what it is, it’s pretty awful and means that I pick at my skin in relation to excessive stress to a pretty horrible point of damage to my skin. The acne makes this struggle a lot more difficult. I have had this since I was eight years old, but it’s much worse now.

ANYWAYS. The purpose of sharing this...
I am on the road to recovery for both my PTSD and skin picking, and let me tell you, this oil HEALS. Excess sebum? Gone. Pimples/Acne? Disappearing. Scarring? Healing. Texture? Soft and glowing but NOT oily. 

A few drops goes a long way. This has become my facial and moisturizer all in one. I also (as my skin reconciled itself from the pre-Lapis damage, used the Blue Clay for spot treatment overnight to speed up the healing of the cystic acne I already had. After the first day I was like, woah.

NEVER stop making this Herbivore.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-09-13,The Holy Grail of Holy Grails,"I live by this product and hands down lives up to expectations. As a teenager I suffered from a ance, then my ance turned into a puzzling rash that dermatologist could not figure out ever after taking a chunk off my face for biopsy which came out inconclusive. For those 10 years I have tried ever possible oral pill and cream, (aside from accutane due to the long list of side effects and birth control because my rash is not hormonal). Currently I am taking cephalexin and spirolactone, these pills have changed my life, but I still suffered from redness, oilyness and small belishes. After discovering Herbivore Botanicals from a social media influencer I was orignally intrigued simply by the color of the product, so I decided to pay a little more than I usually would for a face product. I can tell you with results that I am so pleased with this product, A couple weeks ago I ran out of Lapis, the redness returned as well as oily skin and small blemishes. I then restocked and continued to us it and now my skin looks better than ever.

Herbivore Botanicals thank you for changing my life, It goes with out a doubt that when you skin looks good your confidence level goes up! Also I was so pleased to find out that the Herbivore is Seattle based, I love to support local businesses.",,,,

My partner had been using the Lapis facial oil for about a week or two and has already seen results. He is less red, less swollen and has been less oily in the T zone. We both have very very sensitive skin (one of the main reasons I decided to become and esthetician) and this product has not irritated either of us one bit. It’s incredible.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-01-06,My Holy Grail!,"I have a phobia of putting new products on my skin because of teenage acne issues, because of that, I only wash my face with a bar of soap and exfoliate once a week with something my esthetician recommended. For the last 4 years, it has worked for me; however, the bar of soap really does dry out my skin and I knew I needed something that would moisturize and exfoliate my skin at the same time. 

I don't just use any products on my skin because keeping my skin clear and healthy is extremely important to me. I began doing some research for a facial mist and the Rose Hibiscus mist came up. I began reading some reviews and there were only a few up considering it was a new product. It took me a while to decide but I finally did and I WILL NEVER LOOK BACK! 

Once I purchased the facial mist, I noticed on Herbivore's website they had the Blue Tansy facial mask and it just looked so refreshing and that is EXACTLY WHAT IT IS! REFRESHING! I will continue buying this product for years to come because I am absolutely in love with this. 

It has not made me break out, and smells so nice and refreshing! It does leave your skin a little red after the 20 minutes of having it on so I recommend doing it before bed. Spraying the Rose Hibiscus after eases the redness and makes you feel like you are sleeping in a bed full of roses! 

The Blue Tansy mask is life changing! its goes on so smooth, smells amazing, and does not affect my skin negatively AT ALL!

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,5,2016-01-02,The BEST Mask.,"I've used this mask a few times now, and I already can see the difference it is making with my skin. When I first opened it, I was obsessed with the beautiful blue color of the mask (though when you apply it, it goes on and dries clear). The smell is quite strong, but nothing that I can't handle. After cleansing my face, I apply the mask and leave it on for about 20 minutes, and then rinse it off and immediately moisturize my face. What I've noticed so far is that my few blemishes--both the visible ones and the ones forming under the skin--have started to disappear, and my skin looks so much brighter and feels so much smoother. I really like that the treatment ingredients in this mask are naturally-derived, so I feel better using it on my skin. Also, I don't find it to be incredibly drying. I highly recommend this mask--it works!",,,,

At this time of the month, I often get many painful and irritating pimples on my chin. There isn't one in sight! The texture of my skin has also gotten a lot better! My skin has seriously never glowed like this! I can't wait to see how well it treats me after a couple of weeks. If you're on the fence about buying this product, just do it! So worth it! I will definitely repurchase.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-07-16,Love this oil,"I love this stuff. Almost through my first fill bottle and I love it! I’ve always struggled with dry flaky skin. This in mix with the drunk elephant c firma has changed my skin! Like woah!
I put on probably 10 drops every morning and night. It absorbs but is still enough moisture for when I put on my foundation. now I glow all day long and don’t even need a moisturizer. 

Ps this is my first time reviewing anything on the Internet ever. Just for the Lapis Oil! 

I was nervous this would break me out but nope. I even see my old chin acne scars slowly fading. 

Will be buying again!",,,,

I used a Blue Tansy balm from the other brand and it's probably too intense for my skin...so my skin broke out a lot. So, I was afraid of using the Lapis oil when I saw the key ingredients. Until I read so many positive reviews..... I decided to buy this mini bottle and now I am hooked.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-06-07,The Best,"I had clear skin most of my life until my late-20s. While I never got all over acne, my chin would constantly break out. I tried pretty much everything but I always had one or two pimples continually. I started using this oil at night about two months ago and I haven’t had anything worse than a blackhead since. It’s pretty amazing.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-05-23,Just. Try. It.,"You guys... this oil has changed everything I ever thought I knew about skincare in the last 28 years of my life. I've always had acne-prone skin and was always struggling for the right moisturizer that didn't leave me oily, greasy, or with more breakouts. Also, I've tried a couple facial oils in the past and thought that they definitely were NOT for me because they would never absorb properly and I'd be left with sitting oil, causing superficial breakouts in the crevices of my face. Not this one. I'm not exaggerating.. I'm just very impressed. It completely absorbs, and leaves my face feeling soft, DRY (somehow), and actually moisturized -- something I never truly experienced with a cream moisturizer. I'll also add I live in south TX where it's debilitatingly hot and humid most days and this oil has never once made me feel greasy. I am enamored.. I encourage you to try it.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-05-14,BLUE MAGIC!!!,"I am a lifelong skincare - junkie and this facial oil is truly special. I am 44 with sun damaged , combination skin that clogs very easily and have used Lapis oil daily for 2 weeks with great results. I have seen major improvements in ; oil regulation, clogged pores, rough texture, brown spots, and redness! While being gentle to my skin and actually bringing down redness Lapis oil has been more effective than prescription creams at addressing all of my needs. This is now a must have in my routine and I have one request for Herbivore - please make a body oil version of this!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-05-06,Changed my skin!,"After having 'perfect' skin for 35 years, I was diagnosed with rosacea two years ago and have struggled to find something to ease the redness and dry patches. I have spent thousands of dollars on products and laser treatments but found nothing until I tried the blue tansy and lapis oil duo. I added the pink cloud shortly after and I'm in love with these products. I've found it difficult to find something that provides enough moisture without being too greasy and causing pustules - but I've experienced none since using these products. My dry patches are smoothed, redness has decreased substantially and I'm able to wear only tinted moisturizer instead of globs of cover up. The smell and feel is luxurious and I look forward to putting them on my face. I just purchased the orchid oil to add to my nighttime routine and looking forward to see how that can also change my skin. Thanks so much Herbivore - my old 'perfect' skin has finally returned!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-04-28,"Brighter, happier skin!","I've been using Lapis oil on my face for about a month now (morning, alternating between Phoenix and on top of Moon Fruit at night recently) and omg my skin looks its best! It quickly absorbs into my skin, and is never oily. The scent took some getting-used-to, but it fades away after a few minutes. It helps reduce my blemishes; I used to get the occasional period pimple, but they quickly disappear now. ♡ Good stuff!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-04-08,Soothing,"I purchased a smaller size of this product along with the blue tansy mask.

I'm already planning on buying a full-sized bottle when my smaller bottle runs out!

This oil is luxurious and smells phenomenal. It soothes my skin *and* the smell transports me to a better place mentally. I love how it's not just a product, but it's an entire experience. 

It has only been a week and it's too early to say what kind of impact this has made on my complexion. However, I will say that this has immediately made my skin look and feel more moisturized and nourished. 

Overall, I am totally loving this oil!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,4,2019-03-28,Blue tansy mask smells different now,Hi I’ve been using your products for 2 years. I love blue tansy which complements lapis and green tea jasmine to reduce my acne and to improve my facial skin in general. But I bought a new jar of blue tansy from my local Sephora store last month and I notice the smell is very different from the previous jars of blue tansy which all smelt the same before now. I think it smells like chemicals? Have you changed the way you make the mask? I noticed the packaging inside is slightly different and it now comes with a white plastic what I assume to be an applicator?,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,4,2019-03-05,Really Does Work for Acne,"First off, this mask works for acne itself. I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because, sadly, it does nothing for scars/pigmentation leftover from acne.

I have absolutely terrible combination skin, with deep pus filled pustule like acne and under the skin bumps since I was in my teens (I'm 31 now). This mask is the only one that has done three things-

i. Definitely shrunk and erased the active acne on my face by 95%.

ii. Drawn out the really painful under the skin bumps and gotten rid of it

iii. Gotten completely rid of those small forehead bumps that appear for who knows what reason

I used to purchase this mask in India off Amazon, then I moved to the UK and used to buy it off sablebeauty. Just a word of information to those buying it outside the US - the mask really is that bright blue colour that it appears in the photographs. If you receive a mask that is green, it is one that has been sitting around for a while.

I learnt this because all the masks I used to receive in India were green (obviously because they would have been held by the shipping company/seller for quite a while, but they still worked btw), but the first time I purchased a mask in the UK, shipped directly from Herbivore, the mask was a bright blue.

Please start shipping to the UK again, because nothing else comes close to the results of this. Thank you!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,4,2018-10-15,Product changed color on me.,This mask was amazing!... Ive been using it once a week for the past month. But I went to put it on this evening and my whole jar was a deep green! It was this beautiful blue now it’s not. Is it still safe to use? Or did the product go bad ? Please help!,,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,4,2017-11-19,An Honest Truth,"I bought this product a little while ago and had the most horrible reaction: huge cyst-like zits appeared after using the mask for several days, and I had never had such bad acne in my life. Herbivore was helpful in sending me a different product to try as a replacement, and I readily agreed to it. However, I was disappointed to find out that Herbivore apparently thinks it's OK to delete negative, yet honest, reviews once customer support has stepped in, as they immediately removed my review of the product after sending the replacement. I feel that it is extremely unfair and dishonest to potential customers, as they have the right to read all reviews, both good and bad, to get a feel for whether a product will work with THEIR skin. Had there not only been glowing 5-star reviews, I probably would not have splurged on this product. I want other potential buyers to know that this product isn't for everyone, and more than likely, other customers have posted negative reviews that have since been deleted as well. I only gave it four stars above in hopes that this review would not jump out to customer support, and remain on the website for others to read. Be wary!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,4,2017-08-18,Working Well So Far!,"I purchased this mask about a month or so ago and have been using it every other day since, with some forgotten days in between. Even so, the days I used them often showed immediate results of how well the product worked for me! I deal with pretty bad acne, though not cystic, and constantly try to search for natural products that will help reduce the inflammation of my skin the acne brings. I've been a huge fan of HB for about 3 years now and this mask has definitely given me good feelings with each use. I'll likely purchase the Blue Spot Treatment Mask to use in conjunction alongside this and the Lapis Oil to really bring out the power in each of them.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,4,2017-07-29,Good but not a miracle,"While the scents, all natural ingredients, and cute packaging are huge plus; I found the Tansy mask (in combination with the Lapis oil) didn't do much for eliminating acne but it works wonders by removing redness and inflammation.",,,,

It makes my skin fresh, clean, and clear! I've been using it for about 3 months and still have the same jar because a little goes a long way. However, I've noticed that the mask itself was a nice bright blue when I first received it and now it has turned a darker brownish green color. Wondering if this is normal? Should I get a new one or keep using? Anybody else have the same experience?",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,4,2017-07-09,Loving So Far,"I'm not one for reviews but this mask is wonderful and so easy to use. The smell doesn't bother me at all and I like that it doesn't take as much product as other masks I've tried. After one use, I had a random stranger ask if I was 22 (I'm 32) and my mom, who sees me on the regular, told me my makeup looked really pretty (which I credited to the mask since I had not changed anything). I will definitely keep using along with the Rose Hibiscus toner and lapis oil. I feel younger, glowy and more confident in my skin using these products and I love the natural quality of them :)",,,,

I have really bad skin with acne, mainly around my chin. i had a lot of thick spots there and when I used this 4 days in a row and then always when I felt like I wanna treat myself, my skin REALLY got better!!! I couldn't believe it, that there's a product, that really helps. It does. I haven't got any pimples in my face anymore, just a few blemish spots which I hope Herbivore does invent a product for too?! for skin after acne. that would be so great! I LOVE THAT PRODUCT SO MUCH and it's so worth the price. also you don't need much for the mask. THUMBS UP! THANKS HERBIVORE for that miracle piece of magic!",,,,

My acne was painful, sore, and inflamed. My cousin recommended this product and let me use it and I can't tell you how much it's cleared up my skin in two days. The redness and soreness have been reduced significantly and my skin appears much smoother. I loved it so much that I ended up getting it myself along with the lapis oil to see what it does to clear the remnants of my breakout! I'm a fan!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/blue-tansy-mask,4,2016-10-14,Had to have it!,"I have been waiting and waiting and waiting for this product to be released in store at Sephora, and I damn near cried when I stumbled upon it the other day. I had already done quite a bit of research on the product, but continued to dig to find both the good and the bad. A few thoughts on first use:

-This product has a very strong smell. It doesn't really bother me and honestly fades after a couple of minutes, but those of you with tender sniffers should beware.

-There's an interesting tingling sensation, but not the kind I got using my glycolic serum the first time. It's far more gentle and feels cooling. 

-A little goes a long way! I used a very thin layer, and got great coverage. I put a little extra on my chin (my big problem area). This mask dried super fast and actually became a little tight. 

Concerns:

- I'm a bit disappointed with the jar packaging, honestly. A tube would have been far better to keep the ingredients uncontaminated and stabilized. I guess this product used to come with a spoon to help scoop it out, but not anymore?? I will purchase one to make this a more hygienic process, but I made do washing my hands thoroughly in warm water.
Please please pleeeeease considering more stable packaging.

Overall, the product worked well. My face looked calmed and felt smooth, and I'm looking forward to seeing the long term effects. 5/5 quality, but a 4/5 for some of the obvious issues. I followed up with the lapis oil sample mixed with my B Hydra gel!",,,,

My skin didn't clear up quite as much as I expected (I followed the directions and used the mask everyday for 3-4 days and then 1-3 times a week after that). My skin DEFINITELY cleared some and my combination (oiler T-zone/chin and dryer cheeks) definitely became more consistent. This works really well when you use it with the Lapis facial oil as well.

Because of the burning, my pores are in a sort of scabbed state and they become clogged causing whiteheads which I usually do not get. I don’t know if I have over used this product but I’m wondering if anything has changed in formulation. I used the product as the package stated and not two consecutive days. maybe for sensitive skin try once to twice a week.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-serum,5,2019-10-25,Beautiful Serum,"I'm 35 with dry skin and I can never get through the retinol ""purge"". I've tried so many retinol products that everyone else loves, and my skin still flakes for weeks. Can't do it. After researching, I came upon this. I was extremely skeptical because I'm very picky and thorough when it comes to skin care, but after understanding the ingredients I went for it. I didn't see anything until I used it for a month, and I am happy with the results I've achieved since then. My skin is brighter, tighter and just more fresh looking. With nearly all skincare treatments, please stick it out to see results! It doesn't do a ton in terms of hydration for my dry skin on it's own, but paired with my other hydrating products every little bit helps. I like the watery and VERY SLIGHTLY sticky texture, it sinks in quickly and spreads beautifully. I'm not here to tell you it's a miracle, but it definitely improved my skin and I've repurchased 3 times. If you have trouble with retinols like I do, I really believe you should give this a try (and give it a little time!)",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-serum,5,2019-10-17,Renewed!,"I feel like this is the exact serum I've been seeking for years. It's perfectly subtle, goes on easily, and after about a month my skin looks a lot brighter and like I went through a transformation. At 43 but still with oily skin but worried about wrinkles, this is the PERFECT potion for my crazy skin. The one thing I would want to let others know is, the texture is not like a typical serum and it took some getting used to, but I got accustomed to it after a few times. It's actually way better than I expected it to be.",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-serum,5,2019-09-30,The BEST!,"This is my first time writing a review for a skincare product! I am 28 and have an oily skin when I'm in a humid environment, recently I moved to California and my skin started to break out. It was so dry! also I used to have some fungal acne on my forehead, and I can only use aloe vera gel to moisturize it. 

I have been treating my face by mixing aloe vera gel and squalene oil, my face was better but the dryness is still there. I tried the spinach+kale moisturizer from YTP, but it didn't help much. Anyway, one day I bought Bakuchiol from Sephora to try it out just because I love all the ingredients. 

The result was incredible! I use rose face mist right after the shower, and then apply this bouncy, jelly-water-based Bakuchiol all over my face. I tried only this serum without any moisturizer to see how I feel. My skin is even, smooth and brighter! I don't feel any dryness ever again. I used to have some acne too, especially before my period, but this month I have just some tiny acne spots, I don't know if it is because of this, but I would give credit to it too.

It was so hard to find a product that is clean and water-based without chemical ingredient. Many thanks to Herbivore! I will continue buying this product. Please never ever stop producing this Bakuchiol. It is the best!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-serum,5,2019-09-25,Way Better than Retinol/oids,"I'm a 26 year old man who was using a retinoid (2% in squalene from the ordinary) for about two months. I saw 0 results, and it stressed my skin out to the point where it was irritated, bumpy with tons of pimples just below the skin, and sensitive to the touch, even with an spf 25 I was using. I used it correctly, only at night every 3 days or so at first, then gradually worked up to every other night, then every night. I have sensitive skin and I read all about the ""purge"" that comes with retinol so I stuck with it to see if it worked - it didn't.

I did a lot of research into retinoid alternatives and found Herbivore's Bakuchiol serum and picked one up at Sephora and literally noticed results the next day. My skin was softer and less irritated and bumpy. It's been almost a month now and my skin looks incredible. The bumps are gone, my skin is softer and plumper and has a really healthy glow to it. I use it every evening after washing with cold water and before Aesop's Camellia nut cream (good for sensitive skin), and in the morning I use a touch of diluted apple cider vinegar followed by Aesop's Avail spf moisturizer. Thank you Herbivore!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-serum,5,2019-09-20,Amazing product,"I received this serum as a sample and I'm just about through with it. I used it once a day as part of my night time routine for about three months (Cleanser (different brand), Rose Hibiscus mist, 2% BHA (different brand), Bakuchiol, and then Phoenix oil). I am 30 years old and have pale, redness prone, rough textured, dry, sensitive skin that I've been working to find a reliable routine/remedy for a few years now and a think this is the one! The bakuchiol has made my skin plump and healthy looking. It doesn't turn red anymore (even after a hot shower), and I haven't had any flaking at all since I began using it. I am really, REALLY pleased with this product!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-04-04,Perfect for Men,"This is such an incredible oil at an incredible price - most other oils of this quality are around $80-90 and typically only 1 oz. I have combo skin that is usually very sensitive to new products but found this to be a very gentle oil. While I still found myself getting the occasional pimple here and there, I did notice that the inflammation/redness was much more subdued before using this, as was the recovery time. It absorbed very quickly and left my skin hydrated while also taming natural oiliness. Living in NYC, I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that holds up to the hot summer heat/humidity without melting off my face so I'm excited to see how this will perform. Overall, one of the best oils I've used and I really love the smell (jasmine?)!",,,,

I have tried so many things and nothing has worked as amazing as this oil has. It has cleared my skin up SO much - I can see a difference literally overnight.

My esthetician used this at the end of a facial recently, and I left her salon with a bottle of my own. Although its an oil, but skin doesn't feel greasy or oily. It feels supple, smooth and hydrated. I now use it in replacement of a morning moisturizer and I don't think I'll ever be able to go back.",,,,

This is a really luxurious oil with a beautiful blue color and herbal smell. I use between 3 and 5 drops of this oil morning and night (I only use 3 drops if I've used the Pink Cloud Cream). While I'm still struggling to get my skin back on track, I do think I've seen some improvement. I was initially concerned that this may not be moisturizing enough for skin since it's intended for acne-prone skin, but every morning I wake up with smooth, moisturized skin. Overall, I really like this product and I'm sold on the brand.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2018-01-18,Great for acne-prone skin,"I was very hesitant to put any kind of oil on my face, ever, as a person with severe problem skin, acne, and oily skin. However, I changed up my entire skin care regime and based off review decided to try this. It has REALLY changed the entire texture of my skin to being smooth and supple. Within a couple of weeks it cleared up some very rough oily patches on my forehead. I am very impressed with this and it is definitely worth a try for anyone with oily acne-prone skin who is trying to get their skin hydrated.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-12-27,Love this facial oil,"Since I have oily combination skin I’ve always been a little afraid of putting oils on my face. Even though they say oil combats oil. But still most oils left my face feeling greasy. This oil has really changed my perspective on facial oils. Sometimes this is just fine on its own and I don’t need a moisturizer on top, and other days I like a light moisturizer paired with it. This has kept my skin brighter, more clear, and the oil production has reduced. Also, I love that it’s natural with no harsh chemicals. It’s pricey but so so so worth it when it gives you the results you’ve been looking for!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-12-21,Life saver,This product is sooo great. It works so well and I have oily skin but it never makes me more oily than I already am! Reccomnend for anyone with breakouts!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-11-27,This stuff is UH-MAZING!!!!,"I am sooooo glad I tried the Lapis Oil. I’m 39 years old with oily sensitive acne prone skin, I experienced a major breakout on my face and even on my chest. It was awful! In desperation I ordered the Lapis oil because of all the reviews touting it as a miracle in a bottle. I put it on and overnight the inflammation calmed down. Within a week the pimples and cystic acne were almost totally gone. This oil has also promoted healing and I have very little scaring and discoloration left over. 

In the morning I use this oil after I wash my face with the pink clay bar (also amazing), spritz with the Rose Hibiscus toner then apply my serums, then Lapis oil followed by my tinted sunscreen. At night I do essentially the same thing skip the sunscreen and apply my prescription Taxorac cream (which I’ve used for years, but it didn’t prevent or help as much as the Lapis oil with this last breakout).

In addition to helping prevent and heal acne I’ve noticed my face is less oily than before. Normally I’m greasy by 11am, but now my skin is more balanced and looks more dewy than before. Which is awesome because I’ll be 40 in 6 months and my skin looks super healthy.

If you’re on the fence about this oil I encourage you to try it. I rationalized the price point because this oil replaced moisturizers, acne meds and probably acts as a serum too with all it’s amazing ingredients. Plus is works miracles on my sensitive acne prone skin.

Please never ever stop making this stuff!!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-10-31,Keeping this in my routine!,"I will never go without this again! I have been using this facial oil for a few months now and can totally notice a difference in breakouts when I stop using it. It seems counter intuitive, that not using an oil would mean more acne, but the month that I went without using this, my face broke out and it was painful. The Lapis is soothing, smells amazing, and truly makes me feel like I am caring for my skin at the highest level. I recently started to use it on top of the Moon Fruit, and I am excited to see if I can heal more redness and scarring with the combo.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-08-18,An absolute must-have for me.,"I love this stuff. Being severely acne-prone (I'm on topical meds and basically have an insane life routine to avoid massive breakouts) I was very hesitant to try another ""life changing"" face oil since I've been burned in the past. The fact that this is specifically formulated for acne-prone skin is what made me try it, and I'm SO GLAD I did!

The first few days, I tried it at night only and used it ""straight,"" which made my face seem too oily and slightly itchy. I put it back in the cabinet with disappointment. But then I tried it mixed in with my very plain and light moisturizer (3 drops face oil + half a dime size of moisturizer) and BOOM -- dewy, hydrated, and even-toned skin. 

I also did a little science experiment. In a few weeks I got the bright idea to start using the oil on my chest and back too, where I get breakouts. I've noticed a marked difference in those areas as well using JUST the oil, no topical meds or mask. That's proof positive to me that the oil alone is a powerful healing and preventative agent.

Usually my face breaks out like crazy in the summertime no matter what I do. This summer, using this oil and the blue tansy mask, my skin looks better than it has in years. Seriously. Herbivore, please, please never stop making this stuff!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-08-08,My life is changed!!,"I thank the beauty gods for this oil, daily. I've struggled with acne for the last 14 years. I have large pores, and oily skin, and I'm a mechanic; so my face gets quite dirty at work. I bought this oil 6 months ago, and I still have about 2 month supply left. You wouldn't believe the difference!! My skin looks more even, my T zone doesn't get that gross, sticky kind of oily anymore, and the only blemishes I have, are from hormones around my time of the month!! I use about 3 drops at night, in conjunction with Moon Fruit, and 3 drops in the AM after I tone. I know it's expensive, but give it a try. I'm a customer for life!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-08-03,Amazing oil,I love this stuff - I have oily to combination skin and this is just perfect. My skin is much less oily since I started using this! Not great if you have super dry skin though - sometimes I do have to put on a little extra moisturizer on my cheeks.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-07-28,this stuff actually works!,"So I have struggled with acne for 5 years on and off. I have tried many products and have had some temporary success, however, my acne always came back with a vengeance. I started with mild pimples on my forehead, and lately have suffered with large, deep cystic acne on my cheeks, chin, and upper neck. This is the first product I have used that has effectively calmed my acne with no irritation. This product, when combined with the charcoal bar, the blue tansy mask, and rosewater, has worked wonders. For once, I am not waking up with a new pimple to greet me every morning. My skin is by no means perfect now, but after just 1 month I have seen drastic improvement in both my acne and sebum production. It also feels great knowing the ingredients of Herbivore products are so natural. It is expensive, but in my opinion, highly worth the cost. The smell is strong, but does not bother me in the slightest. If you have tried many products and have had little luck, I suggest you give this a try!",,,,

In just a weeks time I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin.The redness has faded drastically and I havent had one new pimple! Even during my period!!

I have oily skin and I tried other brands and their facial oils, but ended up with an even bigger mess on a face. Herbivore Lapis reduced my hormonal acne over night and for the first time, I woke with no new pimples. It's been two weeks and my skin is 100% clear. Clear. Soft. Happy. I use five drops day and night and while it is on the pricier end, it will last a very long time. My only dislike is the smell. However it fades and is gone within 20mins or so. But it works so well that I look forward to using it and honestly, the smell is growing on me. The first use was a bit of a shock but I'm so beyond pleased with the results.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-07-09,Thank you for this product,"My skin has always been oily and acne prone. My mom is an esthetician and has provided me with an array of products to try in my teenage and adult life-time, most of which have not helped me. I purchased the smaller roller-ball of this to just give it a try. I've used the Blue Tansy Mask and have absolutely loved it, but this being an oil made me nervous to put on my hyper-sensitive skin. I've used so many different oils in the past and all have made me react in red, inflamed breakouts. I took the risk and have diligently used this night and day for a while, and I have to say, my skin has cleared up (even during hormonal days), and has become so healthy and dewy looking. The redness is going away, my pores aren't as noticeable, and the oiliness of my skin isn't even an issue anymore. I have been wearing this under my foundation also (after allowing it to fully soak in). Usually 3 hours in, my skin would have become greasy and need to be blotted. Today I put my make up on at 7am, went the entire day until 11pm with the same makeup. Not once did I need to blot my skin, because there was no excess oil, and my makeup still looked great. I think today was the point where I realized how much the Lapis oil has helped me, and how it honestly does what it is described to do. Thank you Herbivore for creating a product that has surpassed all my expectations, where many others have not. I will continue to keep purchasing this product, and I hope the formula never changes!",,,,

I use it after cleansing, toning, and using the Blue Tansy mask, and so far I can honestly say my face has gotten a lot smoother, cleaner, hydrated, and less red in that time. I use the Jade facial roller to massage this oil into my face for a few minutes whenever I apply it, and it absorbs nicely (doesn't leave an oily residue).

My skin is extremely sensitive and I have to be super careful with what I put on it. I recently went cold turkey on a strong steroid cream I was putting on my face and my skin went crazy! It was going through the withdrawal process (red skin syndrome) and it was sooo red and dried out.

I decided to give this a go, paired with a regular moisturizer afterwards to see if it would help with dryness/redness, and it definitely did! This magic oil has reduced my redness tenfold! I use it at night before my heavy cream and a little bit in the morning before makeup. I can't say enough how happy I am this product actually helped, as I was honestly expecting not to notice any results.

The smell isn't anything great, but it's not bad either. I like the roller because the application process is so easy and quick. My face eats this stuff up!",,,,

I have had moderate acne since I was 12 and I have tried every product under the sun. I am 28 and was at the end of my rope with having the skin of a 13 year old in the peak of puberty. I initially received a sample in my Birchbox in March and after using it for three days, I already noticed less blemishes and my skin was softer and dewy. I looked online and loved that this product only has natural ingredients and the reviews were great; however, I was not completely sold because as I said, I have tried every product under the sun and nothing worked for me. I decided to order the roller size of this product to let me try it out a while longer. I used the roller for a month and my skin only seemed to improve. At the end of the month I decided to bite the bullet and get the full size. At first I was hesitant because the oil is pricey, but I've decided that glowy clear skin is worth it to me. Today my boyfriend told me my skin looks better than he has ever seen it (we have been together for over 5 years) and that I looked younger (I attribute that to the glow). I love love love this oil. As I am now obsessed with Herbivore, I also ordered the blue clay face soap and have been using it in conjunction with the oil, morning and night. Mostly I love the confidence I have with clear skin and now I wear hardly any makeup because I don't have blemish to hide.",,,,

I have combination skin, usually oily, but flaky around nose. I've heard a lot of good things about this product and did some research and read everyone's reviews and decided to purchase! I have been using for about 2 weeks now and I can tell a huge difference in my skin! I no longer have the flakiness around my nose and my skin just feels healthier!

I had been struggling with hormonal acne (I'm 15) for the past year and a half. I've tried retinoids and creams and potions and nothing has helped clear my skin...until I decided to splurge on this face oil. I cannot thank Herbivore enough for making such a wonderful and effective oil. I bought this at the same time as I purchased the moon fruit treatment and use them every day. The combination of those two products has cleared my skin, saved my soul, and enlightened my being.",,,,

I use it a few times a week at night in place of Orchid, & more often in the summer months. Just like the Charcoal bar soap, Lapis helps clear congested skin but does not over-dry like so many other products. So happy to find something that will actually clear skin & not leave you with flakiness!",,,,

I replaced all my beauty care with herbivores products. Thank you!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2017-05-20,"Smaller pores, fewer breakouts, oil control","I started using Herbivore in January after I wasn't seeing the results I wanted from other expensive brands and wanting to switch to a more natural plant based product. I fell in love after the first week!

This oil has helped reduce my redness. I have sensitive skin and it is not bothered by Lapis, but made beautiful and soft!

I started my herbivore adventure with a week of blue tansy, then brighten. This is my go to oil for keeping breakouts at bay, reducing pimple size and controlling my oiliness.

I now have a skincare ritual I look forward to every evening. Nightly I wash with pink clay soap, alternate with blue tansy and brighten, use the pink clay mask twice a week, then apply moon fruit and either lapis or phoenix.

My skin has tightened, has a nice glow and I rarely have to use foundation (unless I'm feeling fancy)...highly recommend!",,,,

It's a very hydrating oil, smells good, and is amazing to use for a blemish breakout. I typically use it daily after my moisturizer to help seal in the moisture. Sometimes I will mix it in with a moisturizer for additional hydration. I also use it immediately after Herbivore's Blue Tansy Mask to put moisture back into my skin. It helps rid of any blemishes or hormonal breakouts I get during my period or any stressful time. It's a bit pricy for a facial oil, but it's worth every penny. And its gorgeous packaging is an extra bonus and makes my bathroom counter look good ;)",,,,

I only leave a review when I am EXCEPTIONALLY pleased or EXCEPTIONALLY mad. Today I am beyond please with this product. I have used it TWICE. only two times, one of them being today and the red spots from picking acne for YEARS is almost all gone. I got this product in my Burchbox and used it once yesterday morning and by this morning the redness was already gone to the point of being able to cover everything with a BB cream. I promptly ordered more this morning as soon as I noticed the changes. My skin looks so smooth, hydrated, and clear. No more Red spots from where I've picked my face, No more dry patches around or under my eyes, no more breakup on my nose from using bad lotions or primers. I will forever buy this product.

I live in Hawaii and spend my time either on planes, in the ocean, or sweating my moisturizer off, and my skin was a dry-but-oily, blotchy wreck. In the short time I've used this oil, it's nursed my face through two sunburns, a sunscreen reaction, and a couple periods and my skin has never looked or felt this good (how is it so SMOOTH?!). A bottle will last a long time -- I use 5-7 drops twice a day on damp, freshly washed skin, and it soaks in INSTANTLY. Liquid or powder foundation go on like velvet, although I've found I hardly need them anymore. Unbelievable.

The smell and color is wonderful. I think anyone could use this oil. My skin is dry/dehydrated, but my pores get clogged easily. I also have patches of eczema on my eyelids. I haven't had any breakouts, it has reduced redness, and keeps it from getting itchy as well. The eczema on my eyelids has completely disappeared. If you're skin is drier like mine, use about 6-7 drops instead of 3-4. I also use one drop of this to mix with my loose powder concealer and it makes a wonderful little makeup serum that looks very natural.

I definitely DO NOT recommend buying this mask unless you’ve tried a sample first. My skin reacted so badly to this stuff. It was barely on my skin for 3 minutes until it started to burn. I washed it off immediately and my whole face was still burning and red. I washed my face a few more times to try to get rid of the irritating sensation, but the redness is still persisting. I sincerely hope I don’t wake up with a face full of acne now. 

It seems like a lot of people who rate this product poorly seem to have a similar reaction. My guess is that one of the ingredients causes this reaction.

It burned my skin on application which was already a bad sign and it only got worse the more I left it on.

What really upset me though is that I emailed the company to let them know. They contacted me like a month later to say it got sent to their spam folder. They had the audacity to ask if it was still burning my skin. I replied that I was not going to reapply it after the first incident and asked if I could exchange it for another product since this stuff is so expensive. I also was trying to trouble shoot which ingredient was making me react in case it was in other products of theirs. They never got back to me. That turned me off from the company to be honest.,,,,

This did not irritate my skin at all. It took a bit of time to see results because it is so gentle and since I take great care of my skin, it's already in good condition. But now all the dullness is completely gone and there is an added firmness and bounce. This is now a part of my permanent routine, replacing a copper serum I had been using previously.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bakuchiol-retinol-alternative-serum,5,2019-08-23,great alternative to Retinol,"I saw a facialist for the first time in April because I was having bad hormonal breakouts from a BC switch. The facialist said my skin was getting too think from using Retinol ( Tretinoin 0.05% cream). I also hate how in the summer it makes my skin burn so easily, and I was wondering if that was doing more harm than good.I decided to stop using the prescription stuff for the summer. I saw this at Sephora a few months later. 
 I have been using this product for 5 weeks. I don't know if I have noticed any difference in lines or hyperpigmentation, but I definitely feel a difference in my acne in that I don't have any! Normally around my period time I get zits and the frustrating thing is for me now that I am in my 30s a zit leaves a red/dark mark on my face for quite awhile, even if I don't mess with it, so getting one is bad news! My skin has been really clear ever since I started using this. I thought for sure I wold still breakout at that time of month, and I felt a zit coming on my chin, but then it just disappeared before it could get to the surface! I use this every night after I shower, with a few drops of facial oil. I don't think I will get back on prescription retinol if this continues to perform! Great job Herbivore!",,,,

But I may be forever converted to this product as my skin went from horribly broken out around my jawline to completely clear within a week, and mostly after the first use.

I use it after a vitamin C serum in the morning, and I use it with my prescription alezaic acid gel at night, and I’ve had not problems with these ingredients mixing. I’m 30, and I have some lines on my forehead that are becoming somewhat deep-set that have been bothering me for months.

I am not joking I haven't had almost any acne since using this oil.... my forehead cleared up and I haven't had a spot since.... my jawline is the best it has been since I was 16.... like I actually do not have one active breakout right now, whereas before I would for sure wake up with something new, or something was brewing underneath and on its way!! ... No product has change my skin the way this oil has and I pray it stays this way .... I finally feel good about my skin again.... Oh and another side note, around the time I got the oil I also stopped using Tide detergent on my bedding... I thought maybe that was causing some skin issues.... either way... it works!",,,,

I've noticed that I don't break out nearly at all when I use this facial oil and it feels so nice and lightweight on my skin. I have combination/oily skin so I was a bit skeptical as to if this product would work for me, but I'm so happy I tried it out. I've recommended it to a friend who has struggled with acne her entire life and she told me that this oil is the only thing she has used that has actually helped to clear up her skin. I will continue to repurchase this oil in the future since it is now an essential in my skincare routine. I love it!",,,,

All oils scared me in fact. But then, I tried it! How did I live so long without it?! It was hydrating enough to smooth over any dry patches and settle any angry spots on my face but didn't leave me greasy or shiny. It absorbed nicely and made my foundation smoother. At night, I would add a few extra drops and wake up with super nourished skin. I love this oil!",,,,

After trying so many sprays, serums, lotions, I'm so glad to finally find a product that keeps my oily T-zone in ckeck and balanced! I was skeptical at first, but decided to give it a try after reading/watching many reviews about the lapis oil. It is wonderful and light, quickly absorbed and only need to use a few drops!! It does not completely prevents my t-zone from getting oily after mid-day, but definitely significantly reduces the oil production. I say I feel 90% less oily!! It is definitely a staple product for me. Also, I also use the orchid oil on the rest of face. I noticed that foundation/BB cream goes on mush nicer and last longer as well.",,,,

I've never had horrible skin. It was always okay with hormonal breakouts and as I've gotten older my chin and cheeks have become irritated. I noticed my skin looking brighter and a little less irritated the first couple days but now after a couple of weeks my skin is amazing. My face has never liked this good. My pours are so much smaller and clearer and my skin is bright and glows! My skin is also so smooth and looks the best it ever has this is absolutely worth the time and money.,,,,

I have very sensitive acne prone skin and I have been having BAD breakouts for two years. I've spent a fortune in products hoping they would cure my acne. After the dermatologist recommended Accutane I felt hopeless and wanted to try something simple and natural. I started using this instead of moisturizer and the blue tansy mask as well. Seriously, overnight I could tell a difference. Now almost all of my acne is gone! I never write reviews but I felt so helpless and want everyone struggling with acne to use this!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2016-11-22,Transformed my skin (LOVE the packaging & ingredients),"I was searching for ages to find something natural (with no Titanium or Iron Oxides and alcohol) that would help my dry, acne prone skin. I was originally using coconut and almond oil but found they clogged my pores and made me break out even more. I took a chance with this and couldn't be happier! The Lapis oil got rid of my acne and redness in less than a week. After running out, I decided to try the Orchid oil and love it almost just as much. I find the Orchid to be not as hydrating, though I've always had extremely dry skin and I'm in the cold, winter months as I write this (it does smell divine though!). Both oils, however, have dramatically improved the texture and hyperpigmentation of my skin. I can't wait to try the Phoenix oil and other products. It was also important to me to find a good product in good packaging. As someone who tries to live pretty zero waste, it's great that the oils are packaged in glass, with a glass dropper, and sent in recyclable cardboard. They give a generous amount too, so I'm able to keep using them for weeks and weeks.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2016-09-24,Life-changing products,"I have had a constant struggle with hormonal acne (primarily along my jawline) for the past year and though I have had acne problems for years - it has never been this rough before. The pigmentation I experienced from it was probably the worst part, especially as a woman with darker complexion, it just seemed like it was never going to go away. A few months ago I tried the Charcoal Bar by HB and thought it was so amazing that I was immediately hooked on trying more products. My current regimen includes a rotation of washing my face with the Charcoal Bar or Pink Clay Bar, Blue Tansy Mask, Rose Hibiscus Mist, and of course - the Lapis Facial Oil. I first tried the Lapis Oil in the small travel sized bottle because with the $72 price point, I wanted to make sure I loved it. And alas - it has certainly lived up to the expectation like each of HB's products. Since using these products, my skin has totally transformed and is getting that clear and healthy complexion I have been longing for. It has even cleared up acne/scarring I had been getting on my back and chest which is incredible. I highly recommend these products to everyone I know, and of course the best part is knowing that they are natural! THANK YOU HERBIVORE!!",,,,

I was doing research on resurfacing masks and found three with good reviews (this mask being one of them) that I had my eye on. The other two were at a luxury price point ($85-95) so I decided to take the leap and try this one since the price wasn't as steep. Unfortunately, it didn't do much. Actually, I've noticed more pimples and breakouts (really painful ones on my hairline) since using this. I used this for a full month and now I feel I've wasted time and money. However, I like the smell, the scents to me are jasmine and blue tansy. Side note: my mom has similar skin to mine and tried this product alongside me.

The first thing that went wrong was the smell- I thought it smelled like the strong rubber smell in a new shoe store, while my sister-in-law decided it smelled like grapes. After having worn the mask three days in a row at first as instructed, my skin has broken out with dry patches on my cheeks. I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but I also got the two biggest cyst-like zits on my face the morning after first wearing the mask, the first time in my life I've ever had something like that appear on my face.

Disclaimer - I have never used a retinol continuously but I was prescribed it for acne SEVERAL years ago. I used to use it as spot treatment so I know how harsh it can be on your skin (but ultimately effective). Anyhow, this stuff is nothing like that. The consistency is like aloe and a little goes a long way. Careful to avoid the eye area. I use it after toning and under another serum (not Herbivore) and then put Lapis Oil over it. My skin looks incredibly clear and radiant. I am truly surprised that in a week's time I have such awesome results. Lets hope they keep up.

It took me a year to manage my horrible cystic acne & redness, but the scars stayed and even if i wasn't breaking out, I had red and brown acne scars all over my cheeks & chin. On top of that, i'm prone to very intense skin texture. I get small colorless bumps all over my face. I started using this once a day, and the first thing I noticed was how gentle and hydrating it was compared to a traditional retinol. In a month and a half, my acne scars have been drastically reduced AND all my texture dissapeared. It's so powerful, but so non-irritating, and since it's so lightweight and absorbs so fast, it layers great under other products and makeup. But, my biggest concern is how little there is for the price you pay. Although it's practically magic in a bottle, please know this full-size bottle will last you only a month if you use it nightly/daily. Other than that though, it's a miracle. Amazing for all skin types, though I personally have extreme combination (super oily t-zone, super dry cheeks & chin) and sensitive skin.",,,,

It also did not noticeably break me out at all. I can't really tell if any fine lines have disappeared from it but it seems to be a nice additive to my day AND night skin routine. The smell is pleasant, I love that there is no added dyes or fragrances to it as I refuse to use products that have either of those two things unnecessarily added. It is slightly slimy but I have learned to love it only because it does not tighten my skin the way the usual serum does. 

If you all are looking to see if it works I suggest you try a sample size of it to see if it works for you since the price is pretty steep. Not sure if I will repurchase but I am satisfied with using it for now.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2016-09-17,Tragically Obsessed,"I can't not tell you about this oil. As a constant flight risk I am devastated that I have become so attached to this straight up magical potion. Currently traveling with a backpack and this bottle wrapped in bandanas a la hobo stick. Not joking, wrapped up like a christmas package and too important to throw in my backpack. How did I survive without it???? Visiting my Gma and made her try it...she says she has to have it and doesn't care how much it costs. She has very delicate skin because of chemo/lots of red patches and was hooked in one day. I have been using it for three days and I swear on my Granny that my dry patches are clearing up already and I don't have my usual solo migrating pimple. I don't like putting ANYTHING on my face because I always end up feeling greasy but this oil somehow feels totally natural if not radiant. My mother syphoned some of mine because SHE doesn't want to spend any money but has come to the conclusion that one bottle will last her a lifetime and it is better than any of the cocoa/shea butter, almond oil, grapeseed blah blah blah that she barrels through. I don't need more than three drops to evenly dose my face and I don't need to reapply in dry spots like I do with lotions. Mom also notes that it doesn't leave her smelling like she has perfumed herself, which is high on the priority list.

This oil has honestly become an absolute staple in my personal skincare routine. Also, I'm a licensed esthetician and you can bet your buns I've been telling my clients ALL about this amazingly clarifying, balancing and calming oil. 

I have combination skin that is prone to hormonal/stress related breakouts...so, if that's you--HOLLA---you've found your skin's knight in shining armor!

I work at a summer camp and am outdoors sweating for a good chunk of the day, and it's taken quite the toll on my skin. I naturally have acne-prone and combination skin, so it's always difficult to find a moisturizer that provides moisture but not oil.

I have converted several skeptics to facial oils with the Lapis oil; it's not difficult to convince my friends to try it when they are asking why my skin looks so good. I've always had blemish-prone, sensitive skin, which used to be combination and is now more dry as I enter my thirties. Lapis reduces my redness and calms any irritation, and I rarely get pimples or even blackheads anymore! I don't usually need additional moisturizer, so this has also simplified my daily routine (just wash/exfoliate and Lapis oil).

If you have oily skin and are worried about applying more oil to the skin, you have nothing to worry about with this stuff!! My skin is actually LESS oily after continued use. 
I purchased the set because the rollerball is so ideal for travel. I will never stop buying this stuff, I am a forever Lapis Oil customer!",,,,

Cons: My skin is irritated! I noticed I get tiny acne on my jawline and cheekbone. And it somewhat burns my cheeks.. eek! it's not bad, but unpleasant. It is pricey, however it is worth it because of the good stuff in the ingredient list.

Note: I am 26, so I can't really tell if it's helping with any wrinkles because I don't have any yet lol.
I also read in one of the lower-rated reviews, that someone else had irritation, and it was supposedly the bakuchiol. Their dermatologist said that the skin needs to adjust to the bakuchiol, and recommended applying it once a week. I'm gonna try that, see if my skin adjusts to it for the next few weeks.

The product itself is thinner, and the packaging changes aren't positive. I really liked that in the old bottle, the inside of the container was slanted and the dropper extended into the bottom so you could truly get all of the product out of the jar. I felt that this was an indicator of quality, and thus I was disappointed to find that the bottom of the container is now flat and the dropper is short, so there is not way that I'll be able to get all of the product out.

After seeing my dermatologist he explained that uses of retinols of any kind (plant or not) will cause this reaction to people with eczema prone skin. I am an eczema prone person. I could imagine this doing wonders on regular skin, but I want those who have skin conditions to do spot tests for longer than a week to avoid what I am enduring.

Also, this last time I ordered from Herbivore I immediately noticed my address was wrong after ordering. Tried and tired to contact customer service and they never responded. After a day or two of no response, they just went ahead and shipped over $100 worth of product to nowhere.

I have a big issue with bakuchiol being marketed as the ""more accessible and ethical"" retinol alternative. It's not good for human skin. And herbivore is not the first to be using it. It's been around for years and fell out of popularity because it's so harsh on so many people's skin. I got this as a free sample and I really did my best to give this product a shot given the reviews and seeing the buzz on their social media. Every time I tried to go back to it, using it on small test areas as always, it gives me super deep pressure zits that dont go away for days. The texture isn't exactly pleasing either, it's a sticky gel that doesn't even come out of the dropper well enough. I just don't understand why it has to be like that, sticky and uncomfortable, when other bakuchiol products aren't formulated like that? I tried it half a dozen times trying to give it a chance. I ended up throwing this product away (it was free + I recycled the glass don't @ me) because there is no one I would want to give it to, in fear of the same issues happening to them. There should really be more caution surrounding retinol-like products like this, and this one is EXPENSIVE. They are extremely harsh on the skin and are not for everyone. Plus this one is a really unsatisfying texture. I would have been even more disappointed if I had paid for this pricey product. Be cautious everyone. Try to get that free sample instead.",,,,

I feel like I have tried everything over the years, from cheap to expensive. I have spent a good part of my life trying out what works best for my skin. I started using this because I found a video that recommended the mask. Feeling hella lame about myself because my face looked like a big red mess (as per usual), I caved in and bought the smaller set just to try it out. Now ladies and gents, I have breakouts basically EVERY day. It has been probably years since I didn't get at least one new pimple a day or every other day. DAY ONE of using this product I noticed an immediate change in the way my skin felt and looked. I IMMEDIATELY stopped getting breakouts and didn't have another breakout for OVER A WEEK. My cystic pimples haven't come back since. I have had just a few pimples since I started this product about a month ago, but they actually go away and they aren't big angry ones. I know you're probably sitting there reading this, much like I did, thinking this is too good to be true. I certainly can't speak for everyone, because everyone's skin is different, but I will never be without this product ever again. I use this one in the morning, and I picked up the Emerald CBD Oil as well and I use that one at night (also a fantastic product). I have never felt this confident bout my skin. I almost left the house without make-up the other day....almost...I haven't even given that idea a thought since I was a freakin kid. My dudes, this is worth the money.

I have combination, sensitive, textured, and acne-prone skin that I can usually control very well with diet. I had been using a good quality Jojoba oil and a couple different gentle cleansers for years with okay results but it wasn’t anything spectacular. I got a hormonal breakout all over my face and back after I had my daughter last year and ordered this lapis oil and the charcoal bar cleanser as I’d been looking at this brand for a while, and holy moly. Within days my skin started to clear up and look SO smooth, balanced, and soft, and my persistent redness and irritation just melted away. I didn’t review right away because I wanted to make sure it wasn’t a temporary initial reaction. I’ve now been using this combination for over a year and it’s still my holy grail! I’ve only purchased 2 bottles of the lapis (and I still have months left on my second bottle) which is pretty great for daily application for 14 months, so don’t be unnerved by the price. I recommend this to everyone I know and I’ve given samples to a few friends and my sister and they are all obsessed! 

Notes: I don’t use the lapis oil on my back, just on my face and neck. I do use the charcoal cleanser on both face and back. During my initial breakout I was using the lapis oil morning and night (it did work very well under my makeup if I used a small amount) but gradually weaned to just nightly and I use a sunscreen/day cream in the morning under makeup now.",,25-34,Combination,"Acne, Dark spots, Dryness, Dullness, Oiliness, Pores, Sensitivity"

I'm mostly writing this because I'm afraid that if they don't keep getting amazing (accurate) reviews they'll stop selling this product and THAT CANNOT HAPPEN! I buy a bottle every 6 months. For years I struggled with oily skin until I learned that actually means my skin is dry and therefore, overproducing oil. This keeps my skin hydrated but not oily. It absorbs and does not make me break out at all! I remember reading reviews a while back when I first tried the product that some people were struggling with breakouts or other bad reactions... with every product there are always going to be people who have skin that does not react well. You cannot compare your skin to someone else's. Request a sample and see if this works for you. If it does, it'll change your life like it did mine!!!!",,,,

I’ve been seeing an improvement, but not as much as I’d like. I decided to buy the Blue Tansy mask and I could not believe the results I received from just one use. Clearer, more even toned skin. I decided to stop being afraid of using facial oil on my combo/acne prone skin and try the lapis oil once and for all. I’ve been using it for 2 days and I cannot believe the improvement in my skin. I had a giant pimple on my cheek which was very inflamed as well as some fungal acne on my chin and forehead. They are almost completely gone! I woke up today in happy tears. If you struggle with acne you know the toll it can take on your self-esteem. This oil is my holy grail. There’s no way I’m even removing it from my skincare routine.

Through the past few months, if I stray from this oil, my skin freaks out. Lapis oil calms my skin like nothing else I’ve ever used.

I have been so happy with how my skin has improved after using this product for about 3 months. I have combination skin, but I struggle with terrible hormonal acne and I always breakout around that time of the month. I use the lapis oil nightly in combination with the prism glow potion. I have had noticeably less breakouts and my skin feels soft, moisturizer, and more even in tone. A bit heavy for day time wear but great as part of your evening ritual!",,,,

I have been using lapis oil ( daily) along with the blue tansy mask( twice a week) , retinol a rx strength( every 3 days ) , a good moisturizer( daily ) and a at home micro needling kit( 3 times a week) And my skin has totally done a 360. Before I was having breakouts daily, multiple cystic acne spots . Now I maybe have 1-2 blackheads pop up a week and I spot treat them with lapis or the mask and they are gone the next morning. I cannot rave enough about this product. The price it totally worth it if it means I can go acne free !",,,,

Whereas many face creams just sit on my face, the Lapis absorbs wonderfully and helps my complexion look more even. Moreover, many face creams will cause irritation and tearing if I happen to rub a bit of it near my eyes, but I have not had this problem with Lapis. Now that I am nearing the end of the bottle, I'll be buying myself some more. One note: the dropper has stopped working recently.",,,,

This oil helped my dry nose area, for the couple times i was able to use it until it perished at the airport in the womens restroom. Such a sad moment, as it was still a full bottle!

It has really effected my confidence and made me feel super insecure. This oil has cleared my skin up and faded a huge dark spot I had on my forehead.

I’ve tried all 3 of the Herbivore fave oils and they are all great products. I shied away from the Phoenix oil because my skin is oily, but I had a horrible case of acne caused by another brands products and battled it with lots of drying acne meds. My skin became oily and dry at the same time, and I was left with scars. I took a look at the Phoenix oil ingredients and researched them and they were all safe for my sensitive oily skin. So I ordered a small bottle and I saw very quick results. I’ve since purchased the full size. Now that my skin isn’t dehydrated I still use this oil day and night. It’s not as light as the Orchid oil but it absorbs just as well into my skin. My skin is soft and clear and I’m a few weeks away from being able to ditch my concealer again. I really can’t say enough good things about the Phoenix oil. I also apply it to my lips and it leaves them super plump and moisturized too.

My skin looks dewy, fresh, and renewed. I was concerned that my skin would break out, but I had zero issues transitioning to it. I love the light smell of the phoenix oil and my skin drinks it up. I previously used brands like Clinique and Estee Lauder for skin care, but Herbivore has changed my life. I love that it is natural, cruelty-free, but most importantly, effective!

I have aging skin and have been searching for a natural skincare that would still give me results.
You have a new fan in me, Herbivore. I had high expectations and Phoenix Oil did not disappoint!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-05-31,Finally,"I'll start by saying I have tried a *lot* of facial oils--for fun to experiment but also to find that ""one"". I use oils for the reason Herbivore describes that most creams are full of fillers and water (which usually meant imbalance and oily/dry areas for my skin, and constant breakouts).

I have used many quality oils that I liked for different reasons but none had all the checkboxes I wanted--until this one. Look at the amazing benefits all packed into this oil!! Truly remarkable--and the price point is fair considering many oils I've tried charge more with less than half the active ingredients this has.

Now for the good part--even when slathering my face in other oils I'd use to combat my dry skin, nothing would really correct it. My skin seems to become very dehydrated and tired come night time so I really want to give it love at overnight. But I'd wake up with the same dry feeling. Sun spots, acne scarring, dullness...these were all things I struggled with.

But this oil truly turns the damage around--I'm having more renewed skin than I thought I could. The side of my face that had the scarring and texture is actually fading and improving in clarity. I wake up with soft, glowing skin.

And I'm not allergic, which I'm very used to with many oils. 

This brand is amazing. I will try out all the oils/toners, and even the moon fruit treatment soon.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-05-22,LOVE,"This oil is my favorite cosmetic, hands down. It cleared up the dry patches I was worried were eczema and has almost completely eliminated the acne I get around my period. I didn't think it was possible for a topical product to clear hormonal breakouts, but after having maybe 1 breakout in 6 months since starting this, I'm a believer! I also am pretty sure it has lessened my deep forehead lines and stopped my baby crows feet in their tracks!",,,,

The first time I tried it my concerns vanished. This is one of the best things I have ever done for my skin. The oil absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy feel, keeps my skin hydrated, and a little goes a LONG way—you only need 3-5 drops. While the price looks like a lot up front, the facial oils are probably one of the better deals at Herbivore;I’ve been using this for a month and haven’t even used a tenth of the bottle, so it will probably last me a year. Will definitely repurchase!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-04-03,Unbelievably good product with an unfortunate price tag,"I was almost disappointed at how good this product was for my skin. I bought the small size of the phoenix oil to test it because I didn't want to spend the full price when I wasn't sure if it would break me out. I have eczema, psoriasis and horrible acne with extremely dry skin from tretinoin use. This product made my face GLOW. I have never felt so moisturized and my acne scars from previous cysts that had stubbornly stayed for months have only started to fade since adding this to my routine. I'm tempted to try rubbing it all over my eczema/psoriasis spots on the rest of my body haha. My dry, flakey skin smooths out after applying this in the AM/PM, but after only two weeks my small bottle of phoenix oil is almost gone and I certainly cannot afford more since it is prohibitively expensive. I really want to support this company because I love their ingredients and products, but unfortunately it is just out of my price range :( I'll be crying over my empty bottle in another week on the hunt for a cheaper alternative.",,,,

It literally makes my skin glow and leaves me feeling super moisturized without the greasy feeling some oils can leave behind. Heavy enough to combat my irritable dry patches while still being light enough to use when I get hormonal breakouts. I'm in love.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-06-19,More Than Expected!,"Although at first I had a few breakouts from this product -- which is not at all uncommon with my skin (combination, prone to hairline and t-zone breakouts) -- once my skin adapted to the new oil, the results were beautiful. After applying a base oil, I use this one for touchups. It goes along my cheekbones, on any lingering acne scars, on the bow of my lip, and under my eyes. Then I let it take its time to soak in and reap the rewards! It delivers on the moisture and for me at least had two unexpected benefits: longer eyelashes and softened scars. Highly recommended! 

For those curious, I typically use either Thayer's Witch Hazel toner or Herbivore Rose Hibiscus Mist first, let that dry, then massage in Herbivore Jasmine Body Oil or plain grapeseed oil in a pinch, before applying Phoenix oil.",,,,

this set also came with an extra sample of the emerald oil, which didn't really make sense since that product comes in the set. I reached out and asked for a sample of the orchid oil instead, but was not able to be accommodated.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/wrinkle-fighting-duo-moon-fruit-serum-phoenix-face-oil,5,2022-10-18,Worked for me when steroids didn't,"I developed eczema on my face during my second pregnancy. My baby was breeched, and I was in constant pain - a deep contrast to my first pregnancy. The breakout of eczema began on my chin in the second trimester and would come and go. After giving birth, the eczema took over and I looked like Darth Maul. The intense burning, dryness, and itching was unbearable. My dermatologist said she had no tricks up her sleeve except for a topical steroid and a month long dose of an antibiotic once I stopped breastfeeding. I used the steroid for about 6 months taking the breaks my Derm recommended. Unfortunately, my skin got so thin the eczema got worse and more painful. My eyes felt swollen. I discontinued use of the steroid for good (threw it in the trash) and went back to my routine of cetaphil face wash, then a zinc bar w emu oil, then this Phoenix oil. The eczema disappeared. So, with no steroid and no antibiotic, my skin is beautiful again. I don't even wear makeup on my skin directly. I fill in my brows and apply mascara and lip tint/moisturizer. I will never use a topical steroid again. It almost ruined my face. I will continue to purchase this facial oil and have even gifted it to my mother for her birthday. She is 72 and looks amazing without makeup now. Thank you so much for this product! ",Softer; Hydrated; Glowing; Calmer; Even skin tone,35-44,Dry,"Dryness, Sensitivity"

Randomly saw it one day in a Sephora and the name is what lured me in. Anything with a rose scent, I just have to try! Got a sample but quickly ended up buying it because of how much I loved it just after using the sample. I love a good body scrub and have tried many in the past but I think the thing that sets this one apart from all the rest is how fine the sugar grains are. It's almost like sand and I feel that that makes it so much gentler on my skin, even gentle enough to use on my face! And the coconut oil in it leaves my skin SO smooth and soft. And it smells soooo good, a soft and sweet rosey coconut scent. But what makes this a must for me is that it helps immensely with my keratosis pilaris. A couple of uses a week and I can keep the bumps on my arms completely gone! This is the first Herbivore product I ever tried and now I'm obsessed with all their products and have accumulated a nice collection, yay!",,,,

It's so soft and supple and easy to apply.. none falls to the tub like other scrubs will do. My favorite thing about this is its smell... it has a subtle butter-y smell to it. It reminds me of coconut butter, or cocoa butter.. really rich and creamy. I just love this stuff. Wish it came in like half gallon tubs - I'd soak in it!",,,,

It smells soooo yummy 😭I really do want to eat it lol anyway funny thing is I bought this thinking it was body butter (WHICH I HOPE THEY MAKE PLZZZ) and then I received it and opened it and I was a bit bummed to see it was a scrub but I kept it anyway and I’m not disappointed at all bc this stuff is heavenly! It feels looks and smells amazing💕I’m a sucker for rose scented body products and this is my favorite scent ever and I’m kinda mad there’s no body lotion/butter in the same scent bc I have to get out and cover up this scent by using some other mediocrely scented body lotion/butter (dry kinda flaky skin in winter so it’s a must).

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/coco-rose-body-polish,5,2017-02-24,Gold for me!,"I smelled this inside Sephora store and wasn't too impressed with it, but after reading so many rave reviews, I thought ""why not?"". I've used this about 3 times so far and I am so in love with it. It exfoliates, moisturizes and gives off this perfect coco/rose scent. It goes on very smoothly, slowly melts away and gives off stronger smell as you massage onto your skin. This leaves my skin baby soft and I have not had to use body oil afterward. It will leave your shower floor slightly ""greasy"", but not to the point that you'd have to be extremely careful when moving around. I only need about 1 tablespoon of the product to cover myself from next to toes so it will last a bit longer than you think. Absolutely love this!!!! I wouldn't mind if the scent was a bit stronger so it is more obvious when sniffing. Currently it is very soft and faint and may not smell like anything to some. I hope Herbivore makes perfume or body spray/oil similar to this scent so I can extend this loving smell much longer after my showers.",,,,

I love love love this scent (could see this as a lotion or body oil). It's so feminine and sexy. The oil in the scrub really moisturizes the skin and is absorbed quickly so you just feel soft and not greasy. My guy is always complementing me regarding my soft skin and how good I smell. I wish this actually came in a larger size since I go through it fairly quickly. Perfect product. And beautiful packaging.,,,,

It was expensive, but considering herbivore only uses ingredients that are top quality and good for you I'd definitly buy it again. I use it after work outs as a little incentive. The smell is amazing and it feels moisturizing. I'd love a body lotion in the same scent.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/coco-rose-body-polish,5,2016-09-26,Amazing and worth the $$,"I love this product! I have really dry itchy skin on my legs. After dermatologist visits and trying different lotions I thought it was a lost cause. UNTIL I used this product! My skin feels amazing for days after using, and less itch! I have been using it for about 3 weeks and already can tell that it will be a product I will continue to use because of the improvement I have seen.

I was worried about the smell being too strong (as rose can sometimes do) but it is not strong at all! Subtle and sweet and not overpowering. (I would love to see other scents as well because Herbivore products smell amazing!! Citrine body oil scent?) 

Totally worth the $ for me! Amazing!",,,,

The scrub is not only a wonderful scent, I really feel like it's done a great job of exfoliating my skin as well as nourishing it so far in just the 3-4 times I've used it now. Can't wait to see how it manages my skin now that autumn/winter is arriving, though I certainly have high hopes. Absolutely would recommend this product to others!",,,,

I have quite a few of their products that I use daily (face oils, masks, body oil) BUT I never felt the urge to get this body polish. I finally bought it on a whim and WOW am I glad I did! I don't know why I waited so long! The rose scent is NOT old-lady-esque at all (which I suspect was holding me back - sometimes you order a rose product and it smells...old), in fact, it's quite beautiful and light. My skin is indeed nice and smooth and it's a treat to use. If you love Herbivore Botanicals products and don't yet have this, go ahead and get it!

They almost always have an adverse effect on my skin and I wind up returning them. Not this! I'm definitely repurchasing. I'm anxious to try the blue and charcoal as well. No tight feeling. No clogging. Just clean, clear skin. It's inexpensive, not full of awful chemicals and it works. Just Awesome!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/pink-clay-soap,5,2017-06-03,Pink Clay Bar,"Like most people I was hesitant to use a bar soap. They seem to always be more drying, & can often be messy. I have all 3 bar soaps & Herbivore has converted me! This soap cleans much better than liquid cleansers, but there's no ""tight"" feeling, skin just feels clean. Perhaps it's because Herbivore doesn't use any fillers, but I also find their bar soaps to be less messy, and last much longer than other bars I've used. These are perfect because I use them for face AND body. Pink Clay cleans, but leaves skin supple, and smells divine!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/pink-clay-soap,5,2017-05-20,"Clean skin, long lasting","I started using Herbivore in January after I wasn't seeing the results I wanted from other expensive brands and wanting to switch to a more natural plant based product. I fell in love after the first week!

This soap is awesome. My skin feels clean without overdrying and this bar lasts forever! I'm still on my first bar, which is only maybe half gone and have used it twice a day since January. Talk about a great deal! It has helped reduce my redness. I have sensitive skin and it is not bothered by This soap, but made beautiful and soft!

I now have a skincare ritual I look forward to every evening. Nightly I wash with pink clay soap, alternate with blue tansy and brighten, use the pink clay mask twice a week, then apply moon fruit and either lapis or phoenix.

My skin has tightened, has a nice glow and I rarely have to use foundation (unless I'm feeling fancy)...highly recommend!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/pink-clay-soap,5,2017-05-05,Miracle Worker!,"I don't normally write reviews, but I had to let people know about this. This soap absolutely CHANGED MY SKIN. I have combination, acne-prone skin with pores that clog quickly. I have had acne for about 6 years now (I'm 19) and I have tried dozens of cleansers and skin care products. Nothing has worked like this soap. First off, it smells amazing. A nice sweet, fruity floral. It foams up slightly in the hands/on the skin (however you like to apply it) but feels gentle and soft. I use this on my face twice a day, everyday. I cut off chunks so I don't have to deal with the whole bar and it lasts about 4 months. After I rinse it off my skin feels soft and clean. I can visibly see how much clearer my pores look after use - but my skin doesn't feel dry. My skin is looking better than ever and I rarely get new pimples. My skin is much more balanced and I don't get as oily as I used to.
Please Herbivore, don't ever get rid of this soap. It is so affordable and heavenly, I will never stop using this! I know it's recommended for mature skin, but if you're young and are having trouble with breaking out I HIGHLY recommend trying this!",,,,

My face is like the state of California when it comes to drastically different conditions depending on where you are. I am dry, oily, sensitive, and very prone to breaking out, not quite acne but annoying pimples. This soap gently cleans off all my makeup, and I follow with the Orchid oil in the AM and the Lapis oil in the PM as well as the Blue Tansy mask a few times a week. CHANGED MY LIFE! I have beautiful skin. I can't explain what a confidence boost it is to feel good about my face when I'm sans makeup.

Some people commented on finding the smell unbearable but I actually really like it (I use a lot of turmeric in my cooking so maybe I'm used to it)! I've noticed my skin glowing and overall looks brighter and more radiant. This bottle is on the pricey side but it will last a long time - after 2 months I'm about 1/3 of the way through mine.

I personally have been using oils to moisturize my face for a while but nothing I've found goes on as easily as this without me having to pull my skin around. It really does reduce the amount of redness on my face, and I wish it wasn't so expensive so I could use it as a body oil it's just THAT soft. I have never felt skin so soft in my entire life.

Nothing was helping but the Blue Clay mask, but I wanted something more convenient to use. I noticed a change in my skin within the first 2 days of using. The red spots are fading and so are the bumps. I'm using less and less concealer everyday and I love that. I was nervous about using it under makeup but my makeup actually lasted longer and my skin is a lot less oily. Hopefully it will continue to get less oily as I use it. I love the glow it gives my skin and the scent is really nice, it may not be for everyone but it's very light. I'm definitely going to try the other oils now!",,,,

I've broken out from facial oils before so I was skeptical about this one, but it really is amazing. Within a week of using it, my breakouts calmed, my skin was less red and the dry patches I always had around my mouth and nose were gone. I also received compliments on my skin from friends and acquaintances who were eager to know what I was using. I haven't touch my prescriptions since and I don't plan to.

Prone to all of the things really. But that's not even it.... Also my skin has recently been so oily throughout the day that I have to reset my makeup multiple times. It was getting ridiculous. If I didn't moisturize, I would get so flaky and red. But if I did moisturize my makeup would melt off of my face all day long. Long story short, I work in skincare and have used literally everything. This oil not only calmed my skin down immediately!..... Within one week of use my skin is the best it has been in years. It does everything! It completely tames redness, heals up any blemishes, is AHMAZING under makeup too!.... I literally cannot say enough. I am completely hooked and obsessed!!",,,,

My skin is acne prone and I always wear sunscreen during the day. My plan for this oil was to use by itself and as an additive to my sunscreen and it works both ways like a charm. 
I'm 37 years old and have been using oils for years in an attempt to replenish suppleness and combat wrinkles. They really work and I think I have found my new favorite line. 
I will be purchasing Phoenix oil next to use at night.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2016-03-15,The benefits will show immediately.,"I ordered this oil with the Blue Clay (I got the Blue Tansy instead, I guess they mistaken that for the other but it's okay) to rescue my oily and acne prone skin. 
This Lapis Oil that is supposed to control oil truly works and moisturize my skin.
I could already tell by the first day of use!

Although I needed to pay custom fees plus expensive shipping here in Italy (that costed me 50€ to get these goodies home)
I really wish they had them in Sephora.it or physical stores in Milan. 

I hope they last me a long time before I need to repurchase!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2016-03-13,Amazing,This product has completely cleared my skin.

I use it in combination with the charcoal soap and my skin has never looked better!!!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2016-02-25,Blown Away.,"Let me start off by saying that I have dry/dehydrated skin with eczema on my eyelids and neck (how lovely). I am prone to congestion on my chin, but really no issues with acne. Since this oil is targeted for more oilier skin types, I thought this oil would be very light and wouldn't help my dry, flaky skin.. WRONG. This has made my face so soft and plump, I'm not even joking. I am super sensitive and I have had no reaction to this oil. For the record, I have never had a reaction from any HB product. I am just in love. The blue color just adds to the beautiful experience with this oil. Also, my face has been recovering from a reaction that I had to a new face wash; flaky, bright red, and very tight with a uncomfortable burning sensation around my nose and cheeks. The Phoenix and Orchid oils really helped my skin to get back to normal (I didn't have the lapis oil at the time). I can't brag enough about this product. I will for sure be buying the full size bottle.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,5,2016-02-22,What a relief,"I was still warming up to the use of facials oils and this one specifically it was converted me to a true believer. I get pimples on my forehead from stress and certain (bad/unhealthy) foods, as well as a few here and there on my cheeks from the changing seasons, and I swear Lapis really balances and helps heal and maybe even prevent. I'm two weeks in and have been using this one in rotation with the other two oils, as well as my other products, and I will be coming back for more when I run out. It's fab.",,,,

It is nice and light enough that I can use it during the daytime (especially with my combination/dry/sensitive winter skin).

Even after a couple days of using the Lapis Facial Oil my skin feels super balanced and that is no easy task. I am always struggling to balance my skin between all my dry patches, redness and the occasional breakout and this product finally is doing that for me. Also you can wear under makeup (just rub in thoroughly and let dry). Most facial oils I have encountered do not wear well under makeup but the Lapis Oil is amazing for day or night and under makeup it doesn't get creasy.",,,,

I never dealt with acne, I'm 27years old and after a bad birth control prescription all hell broke loose. I'm ashamed to same I spent hundreds of dollars on products with no real results. I finally found a good skincare line that has really helped with inflammation and calming down the giant cystic pimples that would pop up daily. Then I came across herbivores on Instagram and decided to add to my routine. I've only been using this oil for a few days and even though I've been getting good results with my skincare routine this has taken it over the top. My makeup applies better, the redness around my chin has gone down, and even the scarring left behind from the cystic acne have started to lighten. I use this at night before applying my moisturizer and I'm really impressed. My acne products can be drying so this gives great moisture and really radiates my skin.",,,,

The smell did take a little getting used to but in the end, I came to love it (I actually look forward to using it). The oil is calming yet effective on dry spots, without being overly oily.

For the first time in my life, I started suffering from adult acne (NOT cool) and to make matters worse...I would get these awful cysts that would stay on my face for months at a time. To say the ol' self esteem took a blow would be a serious understatement. Then Lapis Oil to the rescue! I've been using the product for 8 months now and swear by it! After 3 months of using on a daily basis...I haven't (knock on wood) had one single ridiculous cyst on my face! Also...any other little adult acne has dissipated! Seriously PRAISE for Lapis!!! Thank you kindly!",,,,

I have combination-oily skin that usually becomes oily within an hour or two, so I figured this oil would be the most suitable of the three for me. I've been using this product for a week, and it has already made such a dramatic improvement in my skin. I applied the oil at 8:30 this morning, and by 4:30 in the afternoon there was no sign of any oil on my face - not even on my chin or nose, where it tends to be the most oily. My chin in particular is very acne-prone, and I have been noticing fewer breakouts there since I started using this product. 100% recommend.",,,,

I tried the 3 small ones to see what it was all about. The Lapis seems to work the best for me but the other 2 are really just as good and the phoenix is good for the evening and I know I'm using more than I need to but I just love them! I'm hooked.

But this stuff has taken the redness out of his skin, gotten rid of the dry-flakies, shrunk his pores, and helped a little with seasonal eczema. Oh, and he is having far fewer breakouts, too.

It has been great for my oily skin and keeps me very hydrated. I have been able to tell my complexion is smoother and more even since wearing this oil. It's very lightweight, non greasy, and only takes a few drops (4-6) for your whole face. This product should last me at least a year. The smell is lovely. The blue tansy is the strongest component, in my opinion. It's fragrance is somewhat minty and therapeutic. It's not overpowering at all. If you are familiar with May Lindstrom, the scent will remind you of her ""Blue Cacoon."" I'm a huge fan of May's and have several of her products and adore them but in my opinion, this is more hydrating than the Blue Cacoon and not to mention, a better value.

I have had mixed success with facial oils (I have combination/acne prone skin that tends to be really tight and oily in dry climates), but this is the first one that's soothed my skin during bad breakouts, reduced their frequency, AND kept my skin from drying out during a desert winter.

IT WORKED OVER NIGHT. I noticed improved skin texture, redness, and my acne was almost gone. After only three days I was getting compliments on my skin because they have never seen my skin so clear. THIS IS NO JOKE.

But within a few days I broke out, and it’s one of the worst breakouts I’ve had in years — think painful cystic acne. It’s gotten to the point where I looked at myself at work and broke into tears.

I fell in love after the first week!

This oilhas helped reduce my redness and fine lines. I have sensitive skin and it is not bothered by Phoenix, but made beautiful and soft!

I love the rich smell and texture. I let my face tell me how much I need. A little goes a long way! I have noticed a big difference in fine lines when i use this as an eye moisturizer. It doesn't bother my eyes at all and has helped even out my dark circles and tiny wrinkles.

I now have a skincare ritual I look forward to every evening. Nightly I wash with pink clay soap, alternate with blue tansy and brighten, use the pink clay mask twice a week, then apply moon fruit and either lapis or phoenix.

My skin has tightened, has a nice glow and I rarely have to use foundation (unless I'm feeling fancy)...highly recommend!",,,,

After trialing 4-5 brands in the last half year, I stumbled upon herbivore, which has really complimented my skin. The whole line has been extraordinary the last two weeks but the Phoenix oil is the breadwinner. It goes on very light and absorbs into the skin within 20 minutes depending on how many drops you use. But it's also so nourishing and leaves the skin supple without clogging it. Who knew a quality oil could take the place of cream!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-01-12,SKIN SAVIOR -- will be in my routine FOREVER,"I was skeptical at first but this oil is really a miracle -- and in such a lovely bottle too! You really can't judge a book by its cover in this case! I tried all three oils out by purchasing the roller ball set. ALL 3 oils are incredible and I've been using all 3. I use the Lapis and the Orchid for the day, with the Lapis for my t-zone and the Orchid for my cheeks and jaw area (I have pigmentation there). For the night I use this (Phoenix) along with my anti-aging and repair products. I just wish Sephora had it in-store here in Canada so I can buy it right away and not have to wait for a package!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-01-08,Not just for dry/mature skin!,"My skin is dehydrated and is prone to clogged pores on my forehead. My skin is not oily though. In the summer it can get a tad oily if I have makeup on, but other than that, I don't have an oil control issue. This oil is great. It doesn't sit on the skin, it's sinks in so quickly. The rosehip oil in this product has really helped at evening out my skin along with the brighten mask. The mask plus this oil is a dynamic duo. If you're skin isn't overly oily and you are really wanting to try this I would say go for it! They have travel sizes that last longer than you'd think, so that might be a good option. As for now, it hasn't caused any clogged pores or acne. I'm really loving my skin right now. Thank you, herbivore!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-12-03,"great oil, works well, my new favorite!","I'm looking for sea buckthorn oil for a long time, and finally found this one which includes my most wanted sea buckthorn oil and rosehip oil together. When I use it at night, I just fell very hydrating and absorbed very quickly. The smell are so nice with a note of rose aroma. Also, It's more nature than other facial oil I used. Just fell in love with this oil especially in this winter season. Definitely recommend this one to every one!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-11-17,Really works!,"Excellent, effective, gentle product. I use this at night and it has corrected my dry skin. My skin is also clearer and even toned. Took about 4 weeks to see results.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-08-25,Fountain of Youth,"I was worried that this was going to be too much oil for my already oily face. It wasn't. I did something I have never done before after using Herbivore. I tossed out all of my face wash, toner, serums, and lotions, all of it (some still completely full)! I went back online and ordered more Herbivore product! Thats how good this is. I knew right away everything that I have been doing was wrong for my skin.

 After the second day of use my face was soft, smooth and less oily. After two weeks I noticed the plumpness and youthfulness that I thought only surgery and needles could bring back. 

I use the lapis oil as well, but I use 1 drop of phoenix oil at night around my eyes to keep that thin sensitive skin super moisturized. 

What can I say? I'm in love with Herbivore Phoenix Oil!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-07-23,Wow! Great for combo skin!,"Been using it for about 3 wks... Was afraid Phoenix oil would be too oily for my combo skin (age 38) but my face turns out to really enjoy it! I use approx. 4-5 drops each time (morning and night). Now I am addicted to this and even got my mom (dry skin) to use it (daytime for her; she still prefers LaMer at night). 

I've noticed some skin tone improvements but yet to discover any rejuvenation effect or more miracle to happen. I am satisfied so far and no big pores issues as I've experienced before with another brand. 

Phoenix Oil smells good, keeps my face moisturized and comfortable (even under makeup in mornings), and has really simplified my skincare routine. In fact, this is a great alternative (and actually steering me away) from my other expense creams (CDP La Creme).",,,,

She's a knowledgable beauty blogger so her advice I admired, but I was hesitant to switch from my traditional luxe face cream to an oil. Living in Arizona with intense heat, an oil sounded messy - but regardless I took a chance with Herbivore.

It's the best decision I've made in my beauty regime all year. Phoenix is my new favorite product! My skin soaks it in beautifully, and the oil is so pleasant in touch and smell, I feel like royalty applying it. I look forward to using it every night.

I highly recommend to anyone!",,,,

I actually feel like I can see a difference in the morning after applying at night. I use the Rose Hibiscus mist first and follow with a few drops of this amazing oil. My skin absorbs it quickly and leaves it feeling perfectly moisturized. I've been using Lapis but wanted to try the other oils Herbivore had to offer, and I was surprised I ended up loving this one the most.

The gorgeous fragrance is enough of a reason for me to buy it, but this oil, used in tandem with the Lapis, is my secret potion for keeping skin clear, supple and moisturized. I usually wear a tinted moisturizer and I haven't been using it -- just the oils -- because it makes your skin look so fresh and dewy. This is a fab weapon in my arsenal of skincare products.",,,,

This gave me the opportunity to try the Phoenix facial oil which I Love. It smells lovely and the ingredients are natural and nourishing for my skin. I have very sensitive skin and I was so thrilled that this facial oil was so gentle on my skin. I love the way it glides onto my skin and absorbs so nicely. I can apply makeup afterwards with no problem. At night, I apply the facial oil more generously and when I wake up my skin looks refreshed and moisturized. Great product!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-02-14,Amazing!!!,"I bought this product based on the reviews. It has more than lived up to them. I have only been using this for approximately one week and there is a huge difference in the way my skin looks and feels. It is definitely more even toned, smoother, firmer and feels and looks beautiful. I can't tell you enough how wonderful this product is. When I was younger, my skin was oily and has remained so until about a year ago. So, this was really a challenge for me, as I'm not used to dealing with dryer skin. (My skin still would in no way be described as dry, but for me, it is.) I have tried other facial oils - jojoba and rose oil, to be exact and they were really unimpressive. This - I will never be without this product. It is worth every single penny. By the way, I just turned 60 - if that helps anyone. Thank you, Herbivore for making this product!!",,,,

I'm so glad I did because Phoenix quickly became the oil I reached for the most! 

It feels lush, it goes on smoothly and soaks right into your skin. The scent is very fresh and not overpowering, but of course that is subjective. I use it twice a day under my moisturizer to really lock in long-lasting hydration, but I could see using this alone/on top of a moisturizer. It's perfect for this dry winter weather. For reference, I have normal/combo skin prone to acne and dehydration and this does not break me out. Will be purchasing again!",,,,

The sales person, hoping to make a sale, used some gadget on me that determines how hydrated your skin is. My skin read ""very hydrated"" which surprised the sales person. Of course she wanted to know what I used...when I told her, she said ""Oh"" and walked away... ahem.....

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/phoenix-facial-oil-mini,4,2020-03-12,Best hydrating product on the market!,"I would have never in a million years imagined myself putting oil on my skin!!! Especially thick oils! I cannot stand greasy or oily feelings from anything. I’ve even skipped lotion from time to time and I have combination skin, that is a little sensitive. I bought Herbivores travel sizes in the skin clarifying duo with the blue tansy mask and the lapis oil and the glow+hydrate with this Phoenix oil and I also got a deluxe sample size of the emerald hemp oil. It took me a long time to figure out which one was my favorite, lol because they all address different things. The hemp oil helps to calm any redness or irritation but it’s the thinnest out of the 3, in yet it still offers a ton of hydration. The lapis oil helps to balance sebum production, hydrates, heals acne and acne scars. The Phoenix oil hydrates the most, helps even skin tone, soothes irritation, hydrates and helps heal acne scars. Phoenix is my favorite because of the subtle (not overpowering) rose scent. I cannot even wear perfume because it causes headaches and all of the oils have amazing subtle scents! The lapis smells the strongest, though, like blue tansy. I overdo facials because I have a ton of time on my hands and love how I feel after doing them but I do them too often and it dries my skin out. After I started using these oils it hydrated my skin and kept it balanced, no acne, no blackheads, no irritation. I mean they just healed my skin completely. My skin does not feel oily with these on my face even after I apply serum and moisturizer first!!!! It feels dewy, loose and hydrated and so comfortable!! It takes some time to soak into the skin but once it does it is the best my face has ever felt in my life!! I even ran out for a week and my face was DYING!!! It felt so tight and dry, I could not take it! I bought another travel size of the hydrate and glow because I love the rose mist and the gemstone mask!! I definitely think atleast 1 herbivore facial oil is essential in anybody’s skin care routine because they are just made to heal skin.

It's exactly what I needed in a facial oil, and it did exactly what I needed it to; moisturize. 

The glass bottle and logo is beautiful and luxurious.

However if I'm going to pay 90 dollars for a product, of any sort, I'd expect a better dropper. I don't know if mine was just defective, but the oil came out the seems of the dropper since day one.

This Phoenix oil is lightweight and absorbs instantly, not leaving any kind of film or residue. A little goes a long way. It instantly hydrates and keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day. The roller is super convenient, I apply it directly to my face. The scent is great, it's a refreshing addition to my morning routine!

While this oil is great for gentle hydration, I haven't noticed any improvement to the quality of my skin. This product claims reduction in fine lines/wrinkles, premature aging prevention, and overall restoration/revitalization, but so far I haven't experienced any results to my skin's appearance.

4 Stars - This oil now lives in my gym bag due to the above review... I swim for exercise and my skin gets sooo tight after I rinse off. So I decided to try this post pool and it works GREAT! 

I feel like this should help sway someone who is on the super dry side vs someone in the middle of dry/combo. Don't fully recommend for combo or oily skin.",,,,

Stinky and orange tint on skin.,"So I love everything herbivore but this was just not it. I had used lapis face oil on repeat for years and I was doing great. My skin has always been dry so I decided to get Phoenix which is meant for dry skin and I’m now in my thirties so I am looking for anti aging. 

The oil will tint your skin orange so I could only use it at night. The smell was like rose hip oil infused pickle juice. Not pleasant. And then after a few nights I started to get little red bumps with clear fluids inside pretty much all over my face. Cheek bones to chin to hair line. Such a disappointment. I am giving it 2 stars because it may work for others perfectly well and my skin is finicky. But the smell and color was very disappointing. ",,25-34,Dry,"Dryness, Dullness, Anti-Aging"

I suppose with a name like Rosehip I was expecting something light and floral. This does not smell like that.

I had struggled with chronic, genetic, cystic acne for years, and only recently it started clearing up. I was so happy! I had never really seen my skin clear, and not bumpy or painful. Because my skin was getting clearer I figured I could try some products to help with the scarring (I have horrible acne scars that have left my skin with horrible scars that look like purple bruises all over my face.) I really loved the sound of this product, as it contains neroli oil which is used to lighten scars and promote cell turnover. I bought this small size because I was not about to spend 80 dollars on something that may not have worked for my skin. I used the product for maybe 3-4 days. I will say quickly, the product is beautiful. Package, smell, color..gorgeous. However, after only a few short days, I got 3 cystic pimples...I quickly stopped using the product. It's been 2 or 3 weeks and I still have the scars. My skin was doing well...now I look like I got punched.",,,,

I had “grass is always greener” syndrome I suppose. I tried to fight through reactions and dry skin while my face got acclimated to the new stuff but one morning I woke up and my skin just looked dull and sad and I knew it was time to go home. My Herbivore Box could not get here soon enough! My skin sucked up the lapis oil and within just a few days was alive and happy again! I have definitely learned my lesson and I’m so happy!!,,,,

After making it through my teen years with clear skin, I developed horrible cystic acne in my early twenties(thanks birth control).I’ve been on literally every product for troubled skin, including proactive and accuntane. These things helped clear my skin up, but in the end led to my current struggle with rosacea and eczema. Lapis oil is the answer! After a recent breakout of dry peeling red bumps all over my nose and cheeks(rosacea babes holla!) I bought the sample size and within a week my skin was clear. I have been to countless dermatologists trying to get to the bottom of my skin issues and nothing has helped as much as this simple, delightful oil. What is it?!? Unicorn tears?!?! It’s pure magic and if it ever gets discontinued I will freak the f*ck out....thank you for creating perfection herbivore!!!!!(also please create the perfect cleansing oil...

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2018-09-27,Liquid Gold,"Guys...buy it. Just do it. 

I have Hispanic olive toned skin so it’s oily. I have PTSD so I have high levels of cortisol/stress therefore I’ve been newly blessed with hormonally imbalanced cystic acne. 
Another thing I’m not too excited to share, is that I have Dermatillomania or Excoriation Disorder. If you don’t know what it is, it’s pretty awful and means that I pick at my skin in relation to excessive stress to a pretty horrible point of damage to my skin. The acne makes this struggle a lot more difficult. I have had this since I was eight years old, but it’s much worse now.

ANYWAYS. The purpose of sharing this...
I am on the road to recovery for both my PTSD and skin picking, and let me tell you, this oil HEALS. Excess sebum? Gone. Pimples/Acne? Disappearing. Scarring? Healing. Texture? Soft and glowing but NOT oily. 

A few drops goes a long way. This has become my facial and moisturizer all in one. I also (as my skin reconciled itself from the pre-Lapis damage, used the Blue Clay for spot treatment overnight to speed up the healing of the cystic acne I already had. After the first day I was like, woah.

NEVER stop making this Herbivore. 
Thank you.",,,,

As a teenager I suffered from a ance, then my ance turned into a puzzling rash that dermatologist could not figure out ever after taking a chunk off my face for biopsy which came out inconclusive. For those 10 years I have tried ever possible oral pill and cream, (aside from accutane due to the long list of side effects and birth control because my rash is not hormonal). Currently I am taking cephalexin and spirolactone, these pills have changed my life, but I still suffered from redness, oilyness and small belishes. After discovering Herbivore Botanicals from a social media influencer I was orignally intrigued simply by the color of the product, so I decided to pay a little more than I usually would for a face product. I can tell you with results that I am so pleased with this product, A couple weeks ago I ran out of Lapis, the redness returned as well as oily skin and small blemishes. I then restocked and continued to us it and now my skin looks better than ever.

Herbivore Botanicals thank you for changing my life, It goes with out a doubt that when you skin looks good your confidence level goes up! Also I was so pleased to find out that the Herbivore is Seattle based, I love to support local businesses.",,,,

We both have very very sensitive skin (one of the main reasons I decided to become and esthetician) and this product has not irritated either of us one bit. It’s incredible.

I've always had acne-prone skin and was always struggling for the right moisturizer that didn't leave me oily, greasy, or with more breakouts. Also, I've tried a couple facial oils in the past and thought that they definitely were NOT for me because they would never absorb properly and I'd be left with sitting oil, causing superficial breakouts in the crevices of my face. Not this one. I'm not exaggerating.. I'm just very impressed. It completely absorbs, and leaves my face feeling soft, DRY (somehow), and actually moisturized -- something I never truly experienced with a cream moisturizer. I'll also add I live in south TX where it's debilitatingly hot and humid most days and this oil has never once made me feel greasy. I am enamored.. I encourage you to try it.",,,,

I have spent thousands of dollars on products and laser treatments but found nothing until I tried the blue tansy and lapis oil duo. I added the pink cloud shortly after and I'm in love with these products. I've found it difficult to find something that provides enough moisture without being too greasy and causing pustules - but I've experienced none since using these products. My dry patches are smoothed, redness has decreased substantially and I'm able to wear only tinted moisturizer instead of globs of cover up. The smell and feel is luxurious and I look forward to putting them on my face. I just purchased the orchid oil to add to my nighttime routine and looking forward to see how that can also change my skin.

In the morning I use this oil after I wash my face with the pink clay bar (also amazing), spritz with the Rose Hibiscus toner then apply my serums, then Lapis oil followed by my tinted sunscreen. At night I do essentially the same thing skip the sunscreen and apply my prescription Taxorac cream (which I’ve used for years, but it didn’t prevent or help as much as the Lapis oil with this last breakout).

In addition to helping prevent and heal acne I’ve noticed my face is less oily than before. Normally I’m greasy by 11am, but now my skin is more balanced and looks more dewy than before. Which is awesome because I’ll be 40 in 6 months and my skin looks super healthy.

If you’re on the fence about this oil I encourage you to try it. I rationalized the price point because this oil replaced moisturizers, acne meds and probably acts as a serum too with all it’s amazing ingredients. Plus is works miracles on my sensitive acne prone skin.

Please never ever stop making this stuff!!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-10-31,Keeping this in my routine!,"I will never go without this again! I have been using this facial oil for a few months now and can totally notice a difference in breakouts when I stop using it. It seems counter intuitive, that not using an oil would mean more acne, but the month that I went without using this, my face broke out and it was painful. The Lapis is soothing, smells amazing, and truly makes me feel like I am caring for my skin at the highest level. I recently started to use it on top of the Moon Fruit, and I am excited to see if I can heal more redness and scarring with the combo.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-08-18,An absolute must-have for me.,"I love this stuff. Being severely acne-prone (I'm on topical meds and basically have an insane life routine to avoid massive breakouts) I was very hesitant to try another ""life changing"" face oil since I've been burned in the past. The fact that this is specifically formulated for acne-prone skin is what made me try it, and I'm SO GLAD I did!

The first few days, I tried it at night only and used it ""straight,"" which made my face seem too oily and slightly itchy. I put it back in the cabinet with disappointment. But then I tried it mixed in with my very plain and light moisturizer (3 drops face oil + half a dime size of moisturizer) and BOOM -- dewy, hydrated, and even-toned skin. 

I also did a little science experiment. In a few weeks I got the bright idea to start using the oil on my chest and back too, where I get breakouts. I've noticed a marked difference in those areas as well using JUST the oil, no topical meds or mask. That's proof positive to me that the oil alone is a powerful healing and preventative agent.

Usually my face breaks out like crazy in the summertime no matter what I do. This summer, using this oil and the blue tansy mask, my skin looks better than it has in years. Seriously. Herbivore, please, please never stop making this stuff!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-08-08,My life is changed!!,"I thank the beauty gods for this oil, daily. I've struggled with acne for the last 14 years. I have large pores, and oily skin, and I'm a mechanic; so my face gets quite dirty at work. I bought this oil 6 months ago, and I still have about 2 month supply left. You wouldn't believe the difference!! My skin looks more even, my T zone doesn't get that gross, sticky kind of oily anymore, and the only blemishes I have, are from hormones around my time of the month!! I use about 3 drops at night, in conjunction with Moon Fruit, and 3 drops in the AM after I tone. I know it's expensive, but give it a try. I'm a customer for life!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-07-28,this stuff actually works!,"So I have struggled with acne for 5 years on and off. I have tried many products and have had some temporary success, however, my acne always came back with a vengeance. I started with mild pimples on my forehead, and lately have suffered with large, deep cystic acne on my cheeks, chin, and upper neck. This is the first product I have used that has effectively calmed my acne with no irritation. This product, when combined with the charcoal bar, the blue tansy mask, and rosewater, has worked wonders. For once, I am not waking up with a new pimple to greet me every morning. My skin is by no means perfect now, but after just 1 month I have seen drastic improvement in both my acne and sebum production. It also feels great knowing the ingredients of Herbivore products are so natural. It is expensive, but in my opinion, highly worth the cost. The smell is strong, but does not bother me in the slightest. If you have tried many products and have had little luck, I suggest you give this a try!",,,,

In just a weeks time I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin.The redness has faded drastically and I havent had one new pimple! Even during my period!!

I have oily skin and I tried other brands and their facial oils, but ended up with an even bigger mess on a face. Herbivore Lapis reduced my hormonal acne over night and for the first time, I woke with no new pimples. It's been two weeks and my skin is 100% clear. Clear. Soft. Happy. I use five drops day and night and while it is on the pricier end, it will last a very long time. My only dislike is the smell. However it fades and is gone within 20mins or so. But it works so well that I look forward to using it and honestly, the smell is growing on me. The first use was a bit of a shock but I'm so beyond pleased with the results.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-07-09,Thank you for this product,"My skin has always been oily and acne prone. My mom is an esthetician and has provided me with an array of products to try in my teenage and adult life-time, most of which have not helped me. I purchased the smaller roller-ball of this to just give it a try. I've used the Blue Tansy Mask and have absolutely loved it, but this being an oil made me nervous to put on my hyper-sensitive skin. I've used so many different oils in the past and all have made me react in red, inflamed breakouts. I took the risk and have diligently used this night and day for a while, and I have to say, my skin has cleared up (even during hormonal days), and has become so healthy and dewy looking. The redness is going away, my pores aren't as noticeable, and the oiliness of my skin isn't even an issue anymore. I have been wearing this under my foundation also (after allowing it to fully soak in). Usually 3 hours in, my skin would have become greasy and need to be blotted. Today I put my make up on at 7am, went the entire day until 11pm with the same makeup. Not once did I need to blot my skin, because there was no excess oil, and my makeup still looked great. I think today was the point where I realized how much the Lapis oil has helped me, and how it honestly does what it is described to do. Thank you Herbivore for creating a product that has surpassed all my expectations, where many others have not. I will continue to keep purchasing this product, and I hope the formula never changes!",,,,

I use it after cleansing, toning, and using the Blue Tansy mask, and so far I can honestly say my face has gotten a lot smoother, cleaner, hydrated, and less red in that time. I use the Jade facial roller to massage this oil into my face for a few minutes whenever I apply it, and it absorbs nicely (doesn't leave an oily residue). Love it and will be a staple of my skin care routine from now on!",,,,

My skin gets very oily by the afternoon, but when I apply this in the morning, my skin doesn't get oily at all. I've already noticed a reduction in redness and acne after only using it a few times.

My skin is extremely sensitive and I have to be super careful with what I put on it. I recently went cold turkey on a strong steroid cream I was putting on my face and my skin went crazy! It was going through the withdrawal process (red skin syndrome) and it was sooo red and dried out.

I decided to give this a go, paired with a regular moisturizer afterwards to see if it would help with dryness/redness, and it definitely did! This magic oil has reduced my redness tenfold! I use it at night before my heavy cream and a little bit in the morning before makeup. I can't say enough how happy I am this product actually helped, as I was honestly expecting not to notice any results.

The smell isn't anything great, but it's not bad either. I like the roller because the application process is so easy and quick. My face eats this stuff up!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2017-06-09,Heavenly,"I really can't say enough about how much I love this product. I have had moderate acne since I was 12 and I have tried every product under the sun. I am 28 and was at the end of my rope with having the skin of a 13 year old in the peak of puberty. I initially received a sample in my Birchbox in March and after using it for three days, I already noticed less blemishes and my skin was softer and dewy. I looked online and loved that this product only has natural ingredients and the reviews were great; however, I was not completely sold because as I said, I have tried every product under the sun and nothing worked for me. I decided to order the roller size of this product to let me try it out a while longer. I used the roller for a month and my skin only seemed to improve. At the end of the month I decided to bite the bullet and get the full size. At first I was hesitant because the oil is pricey, but I've decided that glowy clear skin is worth it to me. Today my boyfriend told me my skin looks better than he has ever seen it (we have been together for over 5 years) and that I looked younger (I attribute that to the glow). I love love love this oil. As I am now obsessed with Herbivore, I also ordered the blue clay face soap and have been using it in conjunction with the oil, morning and night. Mostly I love the confidence I have with clear skin and now I wear hardly any makeup because I don't have blemish to hide.",,,,

I've tried retinoids and creams and potions and nothing has helped clear my skin...until I decided to splurge on this face oil.

I use it a few times a week at night in place of Orchid, & more often in the summer months.

I fell in love after the first week!

This oil has helped reduce my redness. I have sensitive skin and it is not bothered by Lapis, but made beautiful and soft!

I started my herbivore adventure with a week of blue tansy, then brighten. This is my go to oil for keeping breakouts at bay, reducing pimple size and controlling my oiliness.

I now have a skincare ritual I look forward to every evening. Nightly I wash with pink clay soap, alternate with blue tansy and brighten, use the pink clay mask twice a week, then apply moon fruit and either lapis or phoenix.

My skin has tightened, has a nice glow and I rarely have to use foundation (unless I'm feeling fancy)...highly recommend!",,,,

It's a very hydrating oil, smells good, and is amazing to use for a blemish breakout. I typically use it daily after my moisturizer to help seal in the moisture. Sometimes I will mix it in with a moisturizer for additional hydration. I also use it immediately after Herbivore's Blue Tansy Mask to put moisture back into my skin. It helps rid of any blemishes or hormonal breakouts I get during my period or any stressful time. It's a bit pricy for a facial oil, but it's worth every penny.

I have used it TWICE. only two times, one of them being today and the red spots from picking acne for YEARS is almost all gone. I got this product in my Burchbox and used it once yesterday morning and by this morning the redness was already gone to the point of being able to cover everything with a BB cream. I promptly ordered more this morning as soon as I noticed the changes. My skin looks so smooth, hydrated, and clear.

I live in Hawaii and spend my time either on planes, in the ocean, or sweating my moisturizer off, and my skin was a dry-but-oily, blotchy wreck. In the short time I've used this oil, it's nursed my face through two sunburns, a sunscreen reaction, and a couple periods and my skin has never looked or felt this good (how is it so SMOOTH?!). A bottle will last a long time -- I use 5-7 drops twice a day on damp, freshly washed skin, and it soaks in INSTANTLY. Liquid or powder foundation go on like velvet, although I've found I hardly need them anymore. Unbelievable.

I haven't had any breakouts, it has reduced redness, and keeps it from getting itchy as well. The eczema on my eyelids has completely disappeared. If you're skin is drier like mine, use about 6-7 drops instead of 3-4. I also use one drop of this to mix with my loose powder concealer and it makes a wonderful little makeup serum that looks very natural.

I was originally using coconut and almond oil but found they clogged my pores and made me break out even more. I took a chance with this and couldn't be happier! The Lapis oil got rid of my acne and redness in less than a week. After running out, I decided to try the Orchid oil and love it almost just as much. I find the Orchid to be not as hydrating, though I've always had extremely dry skin and I'm in the cold, winter months as I write this (it does smell divine though!). Both oils, however, have dramatically improved the texture and hyperpigmentation of my skin. I can't wait to try the Phoenix oil and other products. It was also important to me to find a good product in good packaging. As someone who tries to live pretty zero waste, it's great that the oils are packaged in glass, with a glass dropper, and sent in recyclable cardboard. They give a generous amount too, so I'm able to keep using them for weeks and weeks.",,,,

The pigmentation I experienced from it was probably the worst part, especially as a woman with darker complexion, it just seemed like it was never going to go away. A few months ago I tried the Charcoal Bar by HB and thought it was so amazing that I was immediately hooked on trying more products. My current regimen includes a rotation of washing my face with the Charcoal Bar or Pink Clay Bar, Blue Tansy Mask, Rose Hibiscus Mist, and of course - the Lapis Facial Oil. I first tried the Lapis Oil in the small travel sized bottle because with the $72 price point, I wanted to make sure I loved it. And alas - it has certainly lived up to the expectation like each of HB's products. Since using these products, my skin has totally transformed and is getting that clear and healthy complexion I have been longing for.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-09-17,Tragically Obsessed,"I can't not tell you about this oil. As a constant flight risk I am devastated that I have become so attached to this straight up magical potion. Currently traveling with a backpack and this bottle wrapped in bandanas a la hobo stick. Not joking, wrapped up like a christmas package and too important to throw in my backpack. How did I survive without it???? Visiting my Gma and made her try it...she says she has to have it and doesn't care how much it costs. She has very delicate skin because of chemo/lots of red patches and was hooked in one day. I have been using it for three days and I swear on my Granny that my dry patches are clearing up already and I don't have my usual solo migrating pimple. I don't like putting ANYTHING on my face because I always end up feeling greasy but this oil somehow feels totally natural if not radiant. My mother syphoned some of mine because SHE doesn't want to spend any money but has come to the conclusion that one bottle will last her a lifetime and it is better than any of the cocoa/shea butter, almond oil, grapeseed blah blah blah that she barrels through. I don't need more than three drops to evenly dose my face and I don't need to reapply in dry spots like I do with lotions. Mom also notes that it doesn't leave her smelling like she has perfumed herself, which is high on the priority list.

Bottom line: Vagrants/Mothers/Grandmothers/HouseGuests agree.....THIS IS A MUST HAVE AND A NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT.",,,,

Just before and while I am on that time of the month I use the tansy mask and lapis oil. No break outs!! It also calms the redness on my cheeks. I cant believe having great skin is this easy! If you are struggling with adult acne or redness the tansy mask and lapis oil with be your best friend for life!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-08-02,Astonished & Obsessed!,"Ok you guys. LISTEN UP! 

I've always loved facials oils and the amazing benefits from them. I've recently heard so much talk about this oil in particular, though. So...like the hardcore product junkie that I am, I had to have it ASAP! 

This oil has honestly become an absolute staple in my personal skincare routine. Also, I'm a licensed esthetician and you can bet your buns I've been telling my clients ALL about this amazingly clarifying, balancing and calming oil. 

I have combination skin that is prone to hormonal/stress related breakouts...so, if that's you--HOLLA---you've found your skin's knight in shining armor! 

With its highly concentrated and fast-acting formula, gorgeous aroma and beautiful packaging, this baby is worth every single cent and MORE. 

Ok. Done........I warned you that I was obsessed ;)",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-07-30,LOVE,"I love how gentle yet effective this product is. I couldn't justify spending $70+ on the full size Lapis oil when I'd never used it before, so I purchased this as a tester. I love it so much! I work at a summer camp and am outdoors sweating for a good chunk of the day, and it's taken quite the toll on my skin. I naturally have acne-prone and combination skin, so it's always difficult to find a moisturizer that provides moisture but not oil. This is one of my holy grail products now--I use this with the blue clay mask (the mask I use ~3x a week; I use this every morning and night), and my skin has cleared up and brightened so much. Will be purchasing the full size soon.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-07-20,Repeat customer :),"Bought my second bottle last month – I can't live without this stuff! I hope Herbivore never ever stops making it!! I have converted several skeptics to facial oils with the Lapis oil; it's not difficult to convince my friends to try it when they are asking why my skin looks so good. I've always had blemish-prone, sensitive skin, which used to be combination and is now more dry as I enter my thirties. Lapis reduces my redness and calms any irritation, and I rarely get pimples or even blackheads anymore! I don't usually need additional moisturizer, so this has also simplified my daily routine (just wash/exfoliate and Lapis oil). It also smells great and is SO beautiful, both in color and in packaging – guests always mention it when they see it on my counter. I can't say enough good things!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-07-17,Shockingly Good!,"I read so many positive reviews on Herbivore products that I knew I had to give them a try. I have oily skin and got the Lapiz roller and Rose Mist, which I read was a good duo to combat oiliness. I knew they would probably help at least a little, but I didn't expect my skin to be glowing and refreshed looking all the time! I've been telling everyone about HB and will be buying the larger sizes regularly, for life.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-07-16,Magic in a bottle,"I'm not one to write reviews but I felt the need to share! I've been using Lapis for a week and my skin has improved by 50%. I'm not even Exagerating. I have combination skin, redness, very sensitive and overall very dull no matter what I use. I'm not good at maintaining and don't like taking extra care even though I've spent a lot of money buying high end products that leaves me with no real result. Lapis is insane! All my problems are GONE, redness disappeared, oil control is amazing during the day (I live in hot and humid weather all year round) skin looks extremely balanced and even. I don't wear a lot of make up and I don't even have to now, just some mascara. It has now replaced all my day/night moisturizers. A few drops in the morning, a bit more at night. Just one gorgeous bottle along with some eye cream, some masks, and it's all I need on my shelf. This is what a great product truly is all about. Plus it's all natural, smells beautiful, absolutely gorgeous packaging. I can't believe it took me so long to try it out but I'm sorted now. Can't wait to try the rest. Thank you!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-07-11,BEST FACE OIL EVER,I'm a previous interior design student and I've learned about Lapis Lazuli. I was curious since a skincare version of that egyptian stone? THIS IS THE BEST FACIAL OIL EVER. This may be an oil but it will never leave your skin oily. My skin never felt this soft,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-07-10,Best natural product I've ever tried!,"I have extremely sensitive combination skin with large clogged pores. I'm always nervous to try anything new because my skin can react very badly to oils, chemicals. So even though my current routine isn't working perfectly I pause at trying things. I took a chance at trying this oil only because so many people with my skin problems raved about it. 

I'm four days in already I can't live without this! My pores look cleaner and smaller already and it looks so much smoother and clearer. For the first time I dream of not having to wear foundation to have an even skin tone. 

And the smell of this oil! It's so wonderful I can't wait to use it. I just ordered the blue tansy mask to add to my routine.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-07-06,Game changer.,"I have been thinking about grabbing this oil for over a year now, and I am SO grateful I did. I have been battling adult acne and finally started to get control over it, but I have had a lot of residual redness and old blemishes that just won't heal. This changed that. I have started using this every night before bed, and my redness has drastically improved. I'm using MUCH less concealer these days! 

My one frustration is simply the packaging - enough that I considered withholding a star for it! A rollerball seems a pretty quick way to get bacteria and dirt into the product, and I generally avoid them. I would much prefer a pipet. I gave up on trying to roll it onto my fingers (that just doesn't work) and eventually started rolling it straight onto my face after washing and toning with my apple cider vinegar toner, hoping that the most of the bacteria has been taken care of before subjecting the rollerball to it...",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-06-29,Changed my skin!!,"I picked up a rollerball of the Lapis Oil months ago from an UO just as a little skin pick me up and didn't notice much of a difference because I was only using it maybe once a month. 
BUT!! I picked it back up about a month ago and used it every morning and every night and oh. my. gosh. My breakouts have ceased to exist, my acne scars have faded into oblivion, and it gives me a beautiful dewy/natural glow during the day!! It also smells amazing unlike other oils I've tried.
If you have oily skin and are worried about applying more oil to the skin, you have nothing to worry about with this stuff!! My skin is actually LESS oily after continued use. 
I purchased the set because the rollerball is so ideal for travel. I will never stop buying this stuff, I am a forever Lapis Oil customer!",,,,

No breakouts from the product, and it has been helping calm my hormonal breakouts. I don't feel I'm getting as oily during the day, even going into summer!

I use the soap on both face and back, and the lapis oil nightly over whatever serum I'm using currently (usually either the drunk elephant glycolic serum or the honest company retinol). I just started adding serums in a couple months ago, and they seem to be working very well in combination with the cleanser and lapis oil.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2018-11-13,🌴🐳Clear Days Ahead🏝️🐬,"Can I be honest... For the average consumer $12 for a bar of soap it’s a little on the pricey side. With that being said it worked wonders for me! I didn’t want to repurchase, and switched back to my neutrogena face wash I wanted to get more for my buck.... Worst mistake I could have done!! My skin was not having it. I broke out like there was NO tomorrow my skin dried up so much, I looked like a dried tomato. I finally finished the neutrogena face wash, and re order this soap. I will pay a little more on a product that I know works wonders, and my skin/ face is happy with. Don’t hesitate on purchasing this iteam. You can see a positive difference on your skin when using herbivore products. I wish their line wasn’t so expensive, but it’s expected when their product are made in the US and nautural. I love herbivore botanicals💚🦋🌈:unicorn:☀️️!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2018-09-22,Mindblowing!!!,"Absolutely amazing!! I usually don't like to use soap to wash my face as it leaves it so tight, irritated and dry. This soap though is totally WONDERFUL, it leaves my skin feeling so clean, calm and fresh as no other soap has done before. The smell is very delicate and pleasant too. This is my absolute favorite soap. I want to thank Herbivore Botanicals for creating such amazing and natural products. 
I recommend it to everyone!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2018-09-10,The best face wash!,"I have been using this as my primary face wash for over a year and I love it! I use it with one of those little pink silicon face scrubbers from Sephora and the combo gently exfoliates and provides a deep but gentle clean - no dry skin. Also, a bar has lasted well over 1 year so it is a bargain!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2018-07-22,YES YES YES,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a cleanser. I've always found it strange that when using other cleansers, my face feels stripped and tight after I wash my face. This cleanser does none of that! My skin actually feels clean without feeling like I stripped it to the bone. I have noticed that my skin is more consistently clear and radiant. My skin feels bouncy and lovely. I would highly recommend this product!",,,,

It's reduced the bumps on the back of my legs and arms as well. It leaves my skin feeling silky soft and clean. And, yeah, don't put it in your eyes or nose...because it's soap after all.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2018-01-12,The only cleanser I’ve used for the past year,I tried out herbivore botanicals on a whim because my skin had gotten so irritated and I had perioral dermatitis. I knew I had to change my skincare routine to include more natural cleansers and stumbled upon herbivore botanicals at indigo! Truly has changed my skin. I rotate between all 3 bar soaps. I use the charcoal soap when my skin starts breaking out and find it helps so much. Once my skin relaxes a bit I like to use the pink or blue bar soap. Also I suffer from a bit of booty acne and Black charcoal helps so much! Love and trust everything from this brand.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2018-01-08,In Love!,Over time this cleanser helped me control my acne prone skin. When ever I had a bad break out I would use this cleanser without hesitation. The only thing is I wish it came in a stick form like the Bocsia Charcoal cleanser and the rose cleanser from sum 37. It would just make traveling and storing so much easier! Or at least have that option because I know some people use this bar for there body too.,,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2017-10-21,Been using it for years and I still love it!,"I have been using this facial soap for about three years and I adore it. First of all, the natural ingredients are ideal, and the price couldn't be better. One bar lasts a long time which I really appreciate, and it actually does work. I have acne prone skin and since I started using it three years ago, my skin has cleared a lot. I still have some spots, but not compared to before. I would definitely recommend this product.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2017-09-11,Best soap ever for acne prone skin,I started breaking out on my back randomly and nothing was getting rid of it for six months! I tried this and was clear within weeks and has stayed that way! Just use with a wash cloth. This is the only soap I have tried that truly cleans and rinses off properly. I didn't have huge issues with my face but even using this has made me barely ever get a pimple anywhere. This bar is amazing for head to toe acne prone or oily skin.,,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2017-07-28,so glad I gave this product a try!,"This is a very simple facial bar soap that is gentle yet effective at removing all the dirt, oil, and grime that accumulates throughout the day. It does not irritate my skin, however, it does sting if you get it in your eyes. In conjunction with the lapis oil and the blue tansy mask, this product has drastically helped heal my skin of deep cystic pimples, while at the same time help prevent new pimples from forming. This is the best my skin has looked in a long time, and I am so glad that all of Herbivore's products are natural. Despite my worries regarding the possibly comedogenic oils that this soap contains (coconut and olive), this bar has helped clear my clogged pores and detox my skin. I highly recommend you give this product a try. It is also one of Herbivore's more affordable products which is always a plus. (:",,,,

Noticed more softness on my face (i have combo skin, a bit more on the oily side though) and my body feeling squeaky clean!

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2017-06-03,Charcoal Bar,"I use Pink Clay for face, Blue Clay for body & Charcoal when my face is looking congested. Instead of reaching for a topical product to battle congestion & clogged pores, I find the Charcoal Bar soap works much better. It helps clear up my skin without layering on a bunch of products, which can often make congested skin worse. Depleting all oil can also make skin worse, or cause skin to do the opposite & over-produce oil. The Charcoal bar clarifies and clears, but unlike most products with Charcoal, does not dry skin out. Skin is clear, & balanced, not over-dried or tight.",,,,

I kept it in the shower and used it daily to wash my face as well as a little all over my body and it cleans great! Best yet -- it doesn't dry out your skin like you may assume (like most commercial bar soaps) or make you break out! I used the whole thing up and it lasted me a long, long time! I plan on repurchasing, but would also like to try out the other facial soaps that Herbivore offers!",,,,

I have been using this bar on my face (and sometimes my body) since December and wow! I have oily skin with hormonal breakouts ( I sometimes get a few breakouts chest as well!) . Since using this bar my skin is no longer oily and I have fewer breakouts that go away faster. Not to mention this bar lasts forever and is super inexpensive. I still am using the same bar I purchased in mid December and have a least two weeks left of soap! For those unsure if they want to switch to a bar from liquid face wash just try it! I was unsure how much I would like it and I've found the bar is much easier, lasts longer and is less expensive! Awesome product! I will be purchasing many more in the future!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2017-03-19,Simple yet so effective!,"I bought this soap a little over a month ago, and I just ordered another one. I really love it! I have oily/combo skin and get the occasional zit. This really helps to balance out my skin without overdrying it. It also kept any acne at bay. My skin looks and feels more refreshed. I really love how soft my skin felt after using it. There's so many different products out there that are expensive, but I love that this is natural and affordable. Simple yet so effective! I bought the Blue Clay Bar Soap as well for a family member. Hope they like it, and I'm sure they will.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-11-14,Works wonderfully,"I bought this soap a couple of days ago and I'm not even using the whole bar as I halved it with my cousin. First off, I've never had any serious acne issues on my face as that phase of my life waned after puberty. While I still get occasional breakouts, they're usually one to two pimples that can be easily solved by a trusted Garnier product.

My more pressing concern, however, is my back acne as well as the random little pimples that keep appearing on my arms and back. I really want to get rid of them and I've tried a lot of stuff to get things back to normal. 

I've only been using this Bamboo Charcoal soap for 2 days and so far so good. I double cleanse my face and use the soap as the follow-up to Glossier's milky jelly cleanser. After double cleansing, my face looks brighter and feels super clean. I've also noticed that my face hasn't been that oily so that I look more dewy and fresh, not greasy.

As for the rest of my body, I've noticed some of my little pimples are drying up. If I scratch some of the blemishes a little, a layer will come off. I'm very optimistic these pesky little things will disappear with continued use, so I'm planning on purchasing more bars for the future especially now it's available in the Philippines through Sephora PH. Now I definitely can't wait to try more of HB's products. Thank you for this wonderful product and keep doing the good work!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-10-12,So thankful,I have sensitive break our prone skin. Anything I've used for acne dries my skin out and makes it worse. This soap is soothing and yet clears everything up. My skin has never been so clear and calm. I also use the facial mist and the facial oils. My skin has never been happier. Thank you herbivore botanicals for just making the most gentle effective products out there!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-09-09,Saved me,"The world must know how incredible this soap is! 
When I love something - I have to tell EVERYONE about it - which is why I am writing this review, 

I have struggled with moderate-severe acne on and off for about 4 years. I had gone through a process of trial and error of trying multiple different facial regimens, diet changes, and supplements to try and help my skin. I had gotten it to a point where it was manageable but still very persistent. I just never, ever had clear skin. My skin breaks out most during my period but then that break out lasts up until about a week before my next period. So I have clear-ish skin for a few days, only to break out all over again. 

I started using this and within a week or so my skin was looking clearer! I started accutane and thought this soap would be too drying so I switched and immediately started breaking out. I thought it was the initial break out from the accutane but it never went away. So, I started using this soap again and it cleared up!! if you have moderate acne - this soap could do wonders without needing any additional help. My acne has just been so persistent over the last 4 years that I finally broke and started accutane because I was so over having acne as a 22 year old. 

Try this! It is very very inexpensive and will last a long time. Spend the $12 and stick it out for at least 3 weeks! If it doesn't work for you, it can be used as a body soap too and you won't have spent an exorbitant amount on it. DO IT!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-08-25,Clean,I was super surprised at how soft and smooth my face felt while I was washing off the lather of this soap after the first time I used it. My breakouts have been to a minimum if none and it doesn't leave my skin irritated or dried out. The large dark scary pores on my nose are shrinking and the painful breakouts on the sides of my cheeks have stopped like magic! This skin care line in is A+.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-06-30,Love it),I started using this bar in the winter. I absolutely love how it makes my skin feel. I suffer from adult acne and this has helped my skin tremendously. I still break out from time to time but not nearly as much. I recommend this bar!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-06-28,Worth the money!,"I've been using the soap for a little over 2 weeks now and I have seen great Improvement in my skin. I have combination oily skin which is very acne-prone along with hyperpigmentation acne scars. This soap cleans very deeply into my skin and I notice a difference after the first use. Since using the soap I've noticed less inflammation and acne especially around my cheeks and jawline area. I definitely recommend this up to anyone and it is worth the $12. I plan to repurchase this soap. The only problem with the soap is the size because it is much smaller in person than the image on the website, but it lathers well and and it will probably last for the next two months or so.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-06-24,Love it,Love this bar soap. My face looks clear and feels super soft and I've only used it once so far. Can't wait to see what it looks like after regular use!,,,,

It intrigued me. I read the reviews and felt like I had to try it. I used the soap and after one use noticed the bumps on the back of my arms almost all gone. I'm not sure what causes them, but after I had my first child they showed up. They're not a big deal but having them almost all gone is a great perk.",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-05-14,Best daily cleanser,"I never write reviews, but had to contribute my own praise for this simple soap! I have combination skin, with hormonal acne, and this soap has helped keep my t-zone under control and even gotten rid of the pesky blackheads on my nose! Face feels super clean after washing, but normal areas of skin (cheeks) can feel a little dry after use. I will be buying this soap again!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-05-06,Thank Goodness,"THIS SAVED MY LIFE (and skin). 

Let me explain the type of acne I have/had. I don't get big pimples, but I have these annoying little bumps all over my face (mostly cheeks and around my lips). I can pop 100 easily and 200 will come back strong. If I pop them they temporarily go away until reinforcements cover my face once more. If I don't pop them they don't go away. 

I was losing hope, to say the least. When I turned twenty, acne became a part of me. I tried switching to completely organic everything (soaps, foods, oils) and not even that seemed to help. I changed my diet to vegetarian/vegan, again no change in my face. 
FINALLY, herbivore botanicals had a sale (I'm cheap) and I decided to try it on for size. 
Well let me tell you, sale or no sale I will forever be buying this product. I've used it twice a day for about 4 days now and I can already see a major improvement. 
The second day was pretty gnar because it was exposing all my pores, but now my skin is so fresh and so clean. 

I paired it up w the rose hibiscus spray, so I highly recommend getting that too! 

A million thanks for saving my face!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-04-29,Just give it a shot!,First off I swear I never write reviews. Mostly due to the fact nothing was ever worth praising about. Until I came across Herbivore Botanicals. Only been using this product along side the blue clay mask for roughly 2 weeks now. Over all my years and battle with my horrid skin acne issues have I ever felt this confident in a product. My skin looks so good and in return I feel good about it too! I know I'm praising quickly but never have I seen such results. I have hope that with these products I will be able to have make-up free skin again!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-04-16,A Lucky Find!,"I stumbled upon this soap in a cute local shop, trying to look for a more natural product. I had heard of using charcoal before but hadn't tried it. After having horrible adult acne start two years ago including on my neck that's hard to go away, I gave this a shot (before seeing reviews on the website here). 

My face felt so clean after using this on the first use. After a couple of weeks, my face is the clearest it's ever been! Absolutely love this product and won't go back! :-)",,,,

I have a friend who swore by the product and I was a bit hesitant as i've tried everything from drugstore brands to scrubs bought online. The scrubs really only got rid of scars and stretch marks. So after reading the reviews I finally decided to go for it and to my astonishment its shown results within around a week or two. Ive used this bar every time I take a shower on my face and my back as well after i use the blue clay mask. I recommend this product to people who have suffered from back acne to scars left from acne. I will continue to buy this product as its made my life so much better! So happy that this products as well as Herbivore Botanicals exists (:,,,,

I would say within one or two washes w/ this charcoal soap, I could see a difference in those hard/ under the skin pimples around the chin and jaw line. It is too drying to use for removing my eye make-up, but otherwise I use it once per day on my face and have started using it in the shower too. It does not leave that typical soap film.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-charcoal-soap,5,2016-03-16,Don't hesitate on this one.,"I didn't struggle with acne until college; and its been a pain in my post-grad life. I live in a humid environment, and have combo oily/dry skin. I've tried drug store brands, creams and antibacterials from the dermatologist, and Lush products. My acne got worse with a toner from Lush. So I began looking for a natural product without fragrance and found Herbivore. I've been using the charcoal soap for about 2 weeks and it is the first soap that doesn't burn my incredibly sensitive skin and it actually seems to be clearing up my acne.

I know it takes a while for acne to clear up, but the majority of days in the last two weeks I haven't developed a blemish overnight or throughout the day. I'm confident that Herbivore is the way to go. 

If you've got acne and are debating whether or not to buy this product: just buy it. It's worth it.",,,,

It's been about three weeks and my face looks so good. I don't have any active breakouts and if some start to pop up they go away before getting big. This soap is a life saver.

The all-natural ingredients put my mind at ease and make me confident that I am making a good choice for my body, my health, and my skin. I have already spread the word and will continue to do so. Thank you very much!",,,,

I purchased from Nordstrom again in february 2017, and the formula looked and smelled different. It was less viscous, though still easily absorbed. It looked like they added some darker oils (maybe the orchid was new?) and reduced the coconut content.

I alternate this + Nova + Lapis with Pink Cloud + Moon Dew + Phoenix and my skin has never looked better. Friends randomly stop me mid-conversation to say that my skin looks AH-mazing.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/pink-clay-soap,4,2018-05-26,So far very impressed!,"So far I'm very happy with this. I have sensitive skin that can get dried out and tight when I use the wrong cleanser. So I always opted for the safe route (cream based and mild) but then I would always get occasional breakouts often times wondering if the cleanser was building up on my skin and causing the dry patches to build up on my skin. It was a dilemma--I always wanted a gentle cleanser that could reveal fresh skin without the residue the cream cleansers would leave. But then I would run the risk of red and tight skin after two uses. 

So firstly I got two of the travel oils to try (phoenix and orchid), then I thought well I better just give the whole shebang a try and get a face bar and toner. 

I'm so glad. The bar does not dry out or strip my skin. It pairs perfectly with the other products and my skin feels so much more fresh and anew than it has in a long time. Some sun spots are even fading with the whole regimen. 

I do notice the squeaky clean feeling which I was always warned to not trust because I was told it's not good for the hydrolipid layer of skin, so I reached out to Herbivore customer support and they promptly got back to me within the hour to tell me more about the product. I really appreciated that because so many companies don't take the time of day to answer. 

4 stars so far because I will want to try this when Winter rolls around again to see if it's still gentle but I'm pretty confident it will be, Thank you Herbivore :)",,,,

None of them ended up working out for my face (I do have very sensitive skin that tends toward dryness, so it may just be that bar soap is not for me), but I LOVE them for body. This one is my favorite of the bunch. The scent is lovely and floral but not heavy, and leaves just the barest hint of fragrance on the skin. It lathers beautifully, and is very luxurious. I look forward to using it, which I don't think I've ever said about soap before, ha!",,,,

I purchased this bar as I thought it would be a better/more affordable facial cleanser than what I was using previously but it didn't work for my skin :( It left my face feeling rubbery after use- almost like I had taken a regular bar of soap and washed it with that, and made my skin break out only two days after using. Everyone's skin is different and what works for some doesn't work for others. I'll use this bar as a body bar but I'll have to go back to what I was using for my face.",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/pink-clay-soap,1,2016-07-12,Warning to those with sensitive skin!,"I had really high hopes for this product based on the reviews and ingredient list, I really wanted this to work for me. 

I should preface my review with the fact that I have SUPER sensitive skin. I took a certain acne drug about six years ago and ever since then my skin has been hypersensitive to everything. Most people who claim to have sensitive skin could not even comprehend how sensitive my skin is... I have been using the same 100% natural facial regimen for about 5 years with no problems, but wanted to try this pink clay soap as it looked really natural and really great, plus I thought the kaolin clay would help with some rogue acne on my neck.

I was skeptical about the Blood Orange essential oil right from the beginning, and unfortunately I was right. I honestly do not understand why a skincare company would add BLOOD ORANGE essential oil to a product that is suggested for sensitive skin. Most people with sensitive skin can't go anywhere near anything with a citrus essential oil. Citrus oils are extremely harsh, especially orange oils.

Herbivore - you need to do more research and use a beneficial oil for sensitive skin, not use an irritating oil like blood orange. Aloe, lavender, chamomile or calendula oil would have been a much more appropriate choice.

I had a SEVERE contact dermatitis reaction from using this product on my face. I had to go to a dermatologist and use prescription steroid cream to clear the reaction from this soap.",,,,

The scent is exactly the same as the body scrub, so if you enjoy that scent, you'll like this too. However, I dislike the process of applying the product because it comes in a pump rather than a spray. The pump dispenses the product pretty aggressively where the oil splashes back onto nearby surfaces, which is really annoying. I've tried pumping as slowly as possible and positioning my hands a certain way to cover up the splash back.

I decided to give bakuchiol a try in this 1% form and I was so surprised that I saw similar results to retinol within the first two weeks of use, but without the sensitivity. I have used it every day with zero side effects and I'm thrilled to have found a great alternative!

That being said, I am also glad that Herbivore finally launched a product with a clinical percentage of bakuchiol vs. the product titled Bakuchiol, which does not contain a clinical dosage of bakuchiol nor does it contain straight bakuchiol. I think that Herbivore should consider chanding the title of that product, because it's now confusing with Moon Fruit being launched.",Smoother; Improved wrinkles; Even skin tone; Hydrated; Glowing,25-34,Dry,"Anti-Aging, Dryness, Dullness"

I Really wanted to start using retinol to target those areas of concerns but, a year ago, started IVF treatments, and retinol was not going to be an option for me. After doing some research, Bakuchiol was going to be a safe option for me. There are not enough options out there for TTC and Pregnant woman that are safe WITH results. I’ve been using the new MOON FRUIT for 5 nights now and already not only saw results on the first night, but more importantly, felt the results.

I will be using it for 30 days straight and I'm honestly so excited to see where my acne scars are at by day 30. 

My skin is acne prone and sensitive, common retinol products can be irritating and cause acne flare ups. Moon Fruit has actually HELPED my acne instead of causing it. Bakuchiol is natures Retinol, but better (in my opinion).  I've been pairing Moon Fruit with Phoenix oil and my skin is G L O W I NG. 

In the morning, I use 3 drops of Moon Fruit serum, all over my face & neck.  I let that sink into my skin for about 5 minutes before applying 2 drops of Phoenix oil in a patting motion, not rubbing. 

At night, I do the same but with an extra drop or two for added moisture. When I wake up my skin is soft & glowing.  I genuinely and honestly can't believe how well these products are working for me. Herbivore sent me these for my honest opinion, and now I'm a lifer. I will be buying these continuously.

The cap twists to open or close which is handy if you take it on-the-go for preventing leaks.  The serum itself has a nice consistency.  It is not too thin and watery and not too thick like lotion, but somewhere in between.  It absorbs well without any stickiness or residue.  It has a slight scent that reminds me of grapes (maybe that is due to the purple color).  It was not irritating to my skin at all.  It is moisturizing and helps relieve my face from dryness.

I was getting to the bottom of my Phoenix oil and thought to try it on my dog's skin to use it up.... it only took a few drops on the areas he was obsessively scratching and rubbing it in before he stopped within minutes. Keep in mind he was scratching so bad, he was leaving clumps of fur on the carpet and would scratch throughout the night. I felt so bad for him on top of waking me up constantly. It doesn't take much but applying it close to the skin and rubbing it in works like magic. Guess you can say the Phoenix oil is for the whole family! Some might say it's an expensive solution but a dozen or so drops is a lot cheaper than how much I was spending trying to find a solution.... plus a few drops is well worth my dog's comfort and my sleep.

I put an extra drop of Phoenix oil on my nose, and it's so hydrating and soothing. I burned my arm on the oven recently, and this oil has been soothing and healing the burn so well.

I usually put it on when my skin is still damp right out of the shower or bath, so a little goes a long way.

My aesthetician insists to never put oil on my face but I have defied her for this bottle. 

I started using lapis and ended up breaking out everywhere. I couldn't tell if I were purging or having a bad reaction. So I decided to get a full facial extraction and only use the oil on one side to properly test its effects. Four days later, I ended up with my usual whiteheads on the oil-free side and my lapis side was glowing with much less whiteheads. Overall, impressive but expect to purge.

Although even on the antibiotics and creams and I would break out along my jawline and it didn't seem like the medication could do anything.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-1,4,2016-08-14,Tricky Oil,"I really struggled with this oil! I have an oily T-zone with larger pores and a chin that likes to break out monthly, you know what I mean. I would never ever call any part of my skin dry or say I had true acne. I bought the roller ball set of all 3 oils. 

When I first used this oil, I would apply it all over my T-zone to help ward of oil during the day, along with the Pheonix Oil around my face and apply moisturizer over the top. It dried out my skin near my eyes and me cheeks so bad I thought I was having an allergic reaction. It looked like hives. I'm allergic to Ragweed so it's possible I could have reacted to the related Blue Tansy/Chamomile. 

After a LOT of trail and error I have found this oil only works OVER moisturizer for me. Now my routine is thus: Phenonix everywhere, Orchid on drier areas like cheeks or breakouts, eye cream, cream moisturizer THEN Lapis oil on t-zone, breakouts or irritated skin. 

Now that I have it figured out, the anti-inflammatory properties have really gone to work and have actually helped to heal the spots it had previously been irritating. 

If you're struggling with not making the product work for you or feel like it's making your skin worse, I highly suggest changing the order of your products. Skincare isn't one size fits all.",,,,

Since this is the only thing I changed since last winter, I'm crediting this product. It is supposed to be purifying, so maybe it's a little too drying for my sensitive skin during the winter. I'll put it away until spring/summer and use it only during the warmer months when my skin needs less hydration and more purification.

my skin improved very slightly for a while, but after about a month it returned to its former state and has consistently been acne prone. i also developed small bumps around my smile lines that were colorless, but irritating.

i do have dry skin, and the lapis oil has been great for hydration. i do not think it is effective at treating acne, especially not blackheads.

I had only minor redness and a couple active pimples before I started my new regimen with lapis.

This lapis oil and blue tansy mask are the only change I made in my skincare routine. I used another facial oil in the past and it never breaks me out like this. It’s amazing how it destroyed my skin in 5 days.

I was beyond excited for this beautiful product and was so sad it made my skin worse than it had ever been. I have dry skin that tends to break out around my period. I was hoping this oil would smooth out my complexion and keep the hormonal acne at bay. The first few days using it my face was fine, then I would wake up every morning with a new zit or a few new zits. I continued to use it thinking maybe this is the initial stage before my skin gets used to it and the oil starts working miracles, but it didnt. It also made my blackheads unmanageable and the worst they have been in my entire life! I used it was a little over a month, just hoping and praying it would somehow turn around, but I have officially given up. As soon as I stopped using it, the whiteheads and zits stopped appearing so I know it was the oil because that is all I had changed in my regime.

However, it broke after only one year, and to be honest, I haven’t used it everyday. The metal they use to hold the quartz is pretty cheap. Also, I didn’t like that the metal makes this black thing on the edges of the quartz. It often left some black lines on my face. I am going to purchase another roller but not from Herbivore unfortunately.",,,,

Not only is it aesthetically pleasing but it works very well! I would use it with Herbivore Botanical's Phoenix Facial Oil. However, I had it for about 6 months when today the wiring broke apart on me while using it. I was not at all rough with this product and I only used it 1-2 times a week. After reading other people's reviews on this website, I've come to realize that this is not an uncommon occurance. For the price of this product I believe that it's durability should be much better. I am extremely disappointed seeing as I loved this product. I am currently trying to use a glass glue to fix it.",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/rose-quartz-facial-roller,2,2018-01-06,Aw shucks,"I got this as a gift and was so thrilled to use it because it’s gorgeous and the coolness of the stone feels nice. Unfortunately, the smaller side fell off after the first use, both sides are squeaky and hard to roll, and now the metal parts that are in the rollers are grinding/tarnishing into a black flakiness. Not worth the price. :(",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/rose-quartz-facial-roller,2,2017-11-28,Not great quality for what you pay,"The stone used in this product is beautiful, and feels heavy and well-made. However, there are issues with the brass: first of all, it arrived looking tarnished & scratched already. It definitely did not look shiny and clean like it does in the picture. Second, the large roller side is slightly crooked. The stone sticks up higher on one side than the other. Finally, and this is the worst part, the small roller end was not formed correctly, and will not roll smoothly over the skin. It catches on something, whether the brass wire it's on is not straight, or the stone wasn't smoothed properly. It's incredibly frustrating because to get it to move again, you have to apply considerable pressure, which I don't want to do on my sensitive facial skin. So that side is basically useless right out of the box.
With all these issues combined, the product looks and feels like a cheap Chinese knockoff that I bought on Amazon for $10, which I'm kind of wishing I'd done instead at this point, if I'm going to pay 5 times as much for the same quality.
I understand they're handmade, but that would make me expect difference in colors or shape, not a significant drop in quality from what is pictured on the website.",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/rose-quartz-facial-roller,1,2018-07-10,disappointing design,"I have a love/hate situation with this roller.

Love: the cooling effect. great for massaging products into the skin.

Hate: 
1). the brass color on the roller comes off after few uses. 
I never clean it with any harsh cleanser. water usually gets rid of the gel moisturizer from my face. So it came as a shock when I realized the ""brass"" was almost all gone and it's now mostly the color of silver. 

 2). almost impossible to clean.
Though I said water easily rinses off excess products. Dirt/dead skin will get caught around the two holes on each end of the roller. It is impossible to clean the black blot stuck in the tiny holes. I've tried using a tooth brush/ clean makeup brush/ needle wrapped in tissue paper....etc. Some of the dirt will come out, but most of it won't. it's pretty gross.


For the price of this product, I expected better quality than this.",,,,

I love that it came with a pink pouch for storage after used along with traveling, another plus is company's signage in the middle section of the roller in a gold color. When I gave my mom her new roller, she was happy and surprised with the new packaging and updates made! We both love our new Jade Rollers, thanks Lino and Herbivore! Great customer service and I greatly appreciate Lino for reaching out to me. I love using my Jade roller with their Lapis Facial Oil after masking with Blue Tansy Resurfacing Clarity Mask. Sometimes I switch it up with the Orchid facial oil. Can't wait to try their Brighten Mask and the Phoenix Facial Oil.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,5,2018-03-20,Perfect Tool for the Anxious and Acne Prone,"Not sure how I went so long without a facial roller. This one is perfect. I like using it after a mask/oil or moisturizer because it helps the products sink in. The jade stays cool and feels great on my face and neck. I also tried rolling out a blemish that was under the skin to see if it would help - sure enough it was smaller the next day. If you get anxious when you feel a breakout I highly suggest this to help practice self love instead of ""sabotaging"" your face as my husband calls. The roller will help you take care of your skin instead of destroying it by picking. I also can't say enough good things about the Blue Tansy and Brighten mask and Pink Cloud for anyone that struggles with hormonal breakouts. 

PS - if your roller starts to squeak just put a tiny drop of lapis oil on either side of the stone. Does the trick and smells amazing.",,,,

It's the only thing I've found that instantly soothes my nausea. I also use it in the morning when I get up to reduce inflammation. The sensation is similar to splashing your face with cool water. I love the texture, and mine is not squeaky/noisy. I was worried this would be a purchase I would use once, then quickly forget about, but it hasn't been the case. I've even used it for headaches.

Mine arrived broken - the smaller roller had fallen out, but I was able to wriggle it back in place and tighten it with a pliers. My roller also squeaks when I use it, but I guess I don't mind. Additionally, the roller is branded with a faint Herbivore logo on the stem, which isn't shown in the product photos, and which I don't really care for. Other than those minor things, the jade roller is very pretty and feels great on the face - like a mini face massage! I happened to unpackage mine on a particularly puffy-feeling morning, and I really do think it made a difference. Happy to have another Herbivore product in my bathroom.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,4,2017-10-09,Good but squeeky,"I had no idea I would get two jade rollers for this price, but they sent me two! Not sure if mistake or not? Anyway, this roller is great, it's just very squeaky. Each and every roll you hear it squeaking back and forth. Otherwise it's very refreshing and soothing for the skin. I think with consistent use, my skin will tighten and glow. Be sure to look up videos on how to use, as it's very important to roll in the direction of lymphatic drainage (toward the temples), and don't forget your neck!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,4,2017-09-09,I love this thing,"So much fun to use. Makes skin feel invigorated, awake and fresh. I like using it before I put on makeup to reduce that sleepy puffy face I always wake up with and at night to work my oils into my face and neck.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,4,2017-02-17,Refeshing,I use it in the morning and it feels so good! I definitely notice it tightens and reduces puffiness and the cool roller (I keep mine in the fridge) helps wake me up in the am. Good buy!,,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,3,2018-08-01,"Amazing Jade, low quality metal","I was so excited to finally try the jade roller and overall it has been a good experience. The stones stay cool and help refresh my skin (which is perfect for the summer!). The only downside is that the metal seems pretty cheap - it's started to wear down after a couple months and smells pretty bad, and it squeaks when I roll it. Definitely keeps me from using it as frequently.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,3,2018-04-30,I really wanted to like this roller but it's so poorly made,"The product itself is beautiful and happy with its rolling application. The first one they sent was super bent out of shape, so they sent me a new one free of charge. It worked great for a couple months, but it's fallen apart. The stone always pops out and eventually the arm fell out. I'm going to try some glue and pliers to it to fix it. I'm sure there's better products out there that will hold up better.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,3,2018-02-27,"Poor product, great customer service","1 Star for the product, which broke immediately; 5 stars for the customer service response, so I'll land in the middle at 3 stars. Unfortunately the arm of the jade roller broke the first time I used it. One arm was really wobbly out of the package and after 2 rolls on my face the jade stone shot out and the arm fell off. I emailed customer service and they refunded right away. I didn't want to exchange for a new one because the design is poor and I knew it would break again. The wire arms do not run through the jade stone but merely grip it like calipers. Unless jade is too brittle to drill through, I really think the wire should go through the stone and be in an enclosed loop that can be more deeply set into the handle. More like a rolling pin. Unless it is redesigned, I would not purchase again. Still, customer service was great!",,,,

I was able to make due and fix it for the past month, but tonight, two months post-buy, it completely fell apart. :(",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,3,2018-01-30,Feels amazing but poorly made,"I received my first roller broken and super discolored. Herbivore was nice enough to send me a replacement for free. This one is great and I use it every day while watching TV before bed. Feels SO good and makes my skin look bouncy and alive. It's a little squeaky and because of this, I think it's super overpriced. I gave the old one to my friend and she just sent me a pic the other day of it totally broken after trying to use it once. Disappointing but I'd still recommend. Buy with this in mind.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,3,2018-01-11,It's okay,"It is quite pretty, and I love using it in my night-time skincare routine. However, the bigger roller gets stuck easily and squeaks a lot, and the smaller roller fell off after being used only 2 times! I can easily stick it back on, but it's annoying now because it falls off every time. That's not going to stop me from using it, but I am a bit disappointed because I had chosen to purchase the jade roller from Herbivore (as opposed to Amazon) because I thought it would be better quality...",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,3,2017-11-03,Jury Is Out,"I received my jade order from Herbivore Botanicals today. I used it this evening after getting ready for bed. I really love the cool touch of the jade and the way the larger roller feels against my skin. Unfortunately, the smaller roller gets stuck rather easily and I have to really tug to get it moving again. It’s meant to be used on the delicate eye area and I just don’t see how this would be possible with mine. A bit of a bummer!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2019-03-18,Good but....,"I love the jade roller, it works amazingly but mine broke. The metal part detached from the middle green. I don’t know what to do. :/",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2018-09-19,Not sure,"Just received jade roller today. The item looks so different from the pictures online. The color of jade is very light, not sure if this is Aventurine Jade. The big roller has a dent on it, not sure if it is made for purpose. There is no Herbivore logo on the handle... when it roll on face, both sides have annoying metal sounds... Most ridiculously, the roller does not fit properly into the package it comes with, the roller is a little bit smaller than the dented foam space in the case. I am wondering if this is an authentic Herbivore piece, or a cheap $10 Amazon quality.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2018-08-21,Mixed Feelings – UPDATE,"Ughhhh. Maybe two weeks ago I left what I thought was a fair and honest review of my experience with Herbivore in general, and more specifically the jade roller. 

I came back to check whether customer service had a response or not, and noticed that my review, along with a few other somewhat unsatisfied responses were deleted. 

I feel like this behavior goes against my previously held opinions of this company. It's okay to be wrong (the quality of the jade roller isn't high, in contrast to a stellar skincare line), it's not great to quiet your clients.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2018-08-14,Broken,"I really loved this roller. It's pretty and smooth and rolled my serums on nicely! But it doesn't last all that long for $30. One prong holding the large roller broke off within 6 months of purchase. Would use the smaller side, but it is not smooth enough to use for a facial massage. So yeah... I don't think I will buy a replacement. Such a shame.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2018-08-14,Mixed Feelings,"So, full disclosure, I have loved every product I've purchased from Herbivore. I feel fairly well versed in what's available in the natural skincare market, and have tried much of it. I replace their products when I run out, which is more than I can say for many of the other brands I've sampled. 

That being said, I probably won't be replacing my broken jade roller. At first, it arrived broken in its package (which Herbivore's customer service graciously replaced for free). But less than six months later, I'm re-attaching almost every possible component. 

I'm writing this because I think there is a strange gap in quality with the jade roller in comparison to their other products/items. While it worked, I did notice a radical improvement in the puffiness of my eyes, and even in the lessened frequency of cystic acne. It was also especially soothing to my sinuses during allergy season, and even helped me through a few migraines. 

I may purchase the other non-roller item as a replacement, as I did enjoy the benefits. Just not interested in super gluing a product meant for indulgence.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2018-07-22,You get what you pay for,"Sadly I bought this product in December and after about a week of gentle use the roller popped off during use and I almost poked myself in the eye! I was disappointed but decided that I couldn’t be too upset due to how much I paid for it. However, the mini roller cannot be used instead of the main roller because one side of the cylinder is sanded flat and therefore cannot be rolled properly. I gave up on this item and only decided to write this review now after finding affordable alternatives that work! Personally, I would not recommend to a friend.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2018-06-20,Ugh the smell!!,"I’m not too sure about the quality because the larger roller feels like stone but the smaller one doesn’t feel like a stone... ALSO

When you cleanse it with water and soap because of course your not gonna put something dirty on your face the brass SMELLS SOOO BAD

I was kinda disappointed with the quality.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2018-05-28,The stone popped off and the part holding the stone in place broke off,I used this roller ball a few times and really enjoyed the results until a small piece holding the stone in place completely broke off.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2018-04-23,Fell Apart Quickly,I was only able to use the jade roller twice before it broke so unfortunately I wasn't able to observe the benefits.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,2,2017-11-15,NOT SURE if real jade,"I have had jade rollers before and to be perfectly honest, I am not sure this is a real jade- first of all, it does not resemble jade at all and the weight is also not jade-like.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/new-jade-facial-roller,1,2019-09-11,Not awful,"When I got this product a month ago I was super excited and loved the packaging and the products it came with. When I first opened it and attempted to use it the smaller roller wheeled really well but squeaked a tiny bit, the larger roller wouldn’t spin at all. I thought it might be because it was more like a jade scraper but that wouldn’t account for the fact that it’s on the exact same spinner type support as the little one and didn’t have a solid scraper edge. I’ve just ended up using the smaller side for my whole face and the large side that doesn’t roll to do my neck and décolletage area. I’ve seen tips on loosening a squeaky roller with just a touch of a face oil but don’t trust that this is well enough made to be able to do that. Overall not awful but was really hoping for a better quality when I can get the same thing at a Marshall’s for 7.99 and have it work the same as this one that I fished out 50 Canadian for",,,,

I found that the large half of the roller was squeaky and didn't roll as easily. So I e-mailed customer service to see if I could get it replaced. Never heard back from them . I continued using the roller to see if after some use it would loosen up... The bar holding the stone was loose and fell off so now I'm stuck with a broken face roller. Very disappointed.

My story: I've had troubled skin for years (I'm 30 now), since I was a teenager. Always struggling with acne and oily skin. I tried everything and spent a fortune doing so. Since switching to a holistic doctor, I've taken notice of everything I've been using on and for my body. What an eye opener! Such toxins, such poisons, doing more harm than good. Shortly after, I found you online. I decided to give it a whirl. 
I started with the bamboo charcoal bar soap and the lapis facial oil. Immediate change. Cleared up the acne and kept my oily skin at bay. The whole ""oil cancels out oil"" blew my mind. But it's so very true. Once I noticed the successful change, I ordered the blue clay bar soap (my morning soap) and the hydrate facial toner to add to my routine. People are starting to take notice and compliment me. I finally don't have to stress over my skin and search high and low for something that works for me. 
I couldn't be happier and more grateful that you make such wonderful products. I can confidently say that I my face looks great, I love my skin now. You have a costumer for life. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",,,,

I was hoping the charcoal bar soap would have a rougher texture and exfoliate my skin (as many charcoal products do). Not at all!

Spent close to $300.00. Upon my return to Bermuda, where I live, I found that the dropper/ top of the lapis oil, was not properly fitted, so all of the oil drained in my luggage, the pink soap began to crumble in my hands, so I was left to use pieces of it. The tansy mask had hardened clumps in it and was not the gel like texture that I had experienced with my initial jar. 

All around the quality of the products I purchased was awful. I usually love these products, and have spent a lot of money on them previously, however I'm reluctant to repurchase given the quality I have received.

My one complaint is the bottle pump design. The tube is literally about 1/2 inch above the bottom of the bottle which basically means that when you start to run low you will have to open the bottle and get the oil. At this price I would have imagined that company could have used a longer curved tube to get all the oil out.",,35-44,Normal,Dryness

Now I apply the product right after showering and before drying. It seems to absorb much better that way and you use much less. I use this every other day since Jan 22nd and there is still a lot left. The jasmine smell is lovely (I hate the typical perfume smell on skin care products) and IMO, it is better for the winter since they smell is ""heavier"" and the oil itself is thick. The fragrance stays on for about 4 hours after applied and it is not going to make you sneeze or have a headache if you are allergic to stuff like this. It does make my skin soft (not greasy) but it is not glowy like I thought it would. Would love to have this in coconut for the summer (like the coconut spray). May try the citrine next to see which I like better.",,,,

I’ve tried all 3 of the Herbivore fave oils and they are all great products. I shied away from the Phoenix oil because my skin is oily, but I had a horrible case of acne caused by another brands products and battled it with lots of drying acne meds. My skin became oily and dry at the same time, and I was left with scars. I took a look at the Phoenix oil ingredients and researched them and they were all safe for my sensitive oily skin. So I ordered a small bottle and I saw very quick results. I’ve since purchased the full size. Now that my skin isn’t dehydrated I still use this oil day and night. It’s not as light as the Orchid oil but it absorbs just as well into my skin. My skin is soft and clear and I’m a few weeks away from being able to ditch my concealer again. I really can’t say enough good things about the Phoenix oil. I also apply it to my lips and it leaves them super plump and moisturized too.

I previously used brands like Clinique and Estee Lauder for skin care, but Herbivore has changed my life. I love that it is natural, cruelty-free, but most importantly, effective!

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/wrinkle-fighting-duo-moon-fruit-serum-phoenix-face-oil,5,2018-05-31,Finally,"I'll start by saying I have tried a *lot* of facial oils--for fun to experiment but also to find that ""one"". I use oils for the reason Herbivore describes that most creams are full of fillers and water (which usually meant imbalance and oily/dry areas for my skin, and constant breakouts).

I have used many quality oils that I liked for different reasons but none had all the checkboxes I wanted--until this one. Look at the amazing benefits all packed into this oil!! Truly remarkable--and the price point is fair considering many oils I've tried charge more with less than half the active ingredients this has.

Now for the good part--even when slathering my face in other oils I'd use to combat my dry skin, nothing would really correct it. My skin seems to become very dehydrated and tired come night time so I really want to give it love at overnight. But I'd wake up with the same dry feeling. Sun spots, acne scarring, dullness...these were all things I struggled with.

But this oil truly turns the damage around--I'm having more renewed skin than I thought I could. The side of my face that had the scarring and texture is actually fading and improving in clarity. I wake up with soft, glowing skin.

And I'm not allergic, which I'm very used to with many oils. 

This brand is amazing. I will try out all the oils/toners, and even the moon fruit treatment soon.",,,,

It cleared up the dry patches I was worried were eczema and has almost completely eliminated the acne I get around my period. I didn't think it was possible for a topical product to clear hormonal breakouts, but after having maybe 1 breakout in 6 months since starting this, I'm a believer! I also am pretty sure it has lessened my deep forehead lines and stopped my baby crows feet in their tracks!",,,,

I usually use Farsali oils but I recently tried this one and it changed my life. The smell, omg there is a herbal scent and it is amazing. the texture is amazing as well, very hydrating. I stop using Farsali oils. My heart belong to Herbivore now !!! I can't wait to try different products of your brand.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/wrinkle-fighting-duo-moon-fruit-serum-phoenix-face-oil,5,2018-04-22,Holy grail,"I was hesitant to try Phoenix because I have combo skin, and $88 is a little steep for something I thought might not work out. The first time I tried it my concerns vanished. This is one of the best things I have ever done for my skin. The oil absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy feel, keeps my skin hydrated, and a little goes a LONG way—you only need 3-5 drops. While the price looks like a lot up front, the facial oils are probably one of the better deals at Herbivore;I’ve been using this for a month and haven’t even used a tenth of the bottle, so it will probably last me a year. Will definitely repurchase!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/wrinkle-fighting-duo-moon-fruit-serum-phoenix-face-oil,5,2018-04-03,Unbelievably good product with an unfortunate price tag,"I was almost disappointed at how good this product was for my skin. I bought the small size of the phoenix oil to test it because I didn't want to spend the full price when I wasn't sure if it would break me out. I have eczema, psoriasis and horrible acne with extremely dry skin from tretinoin use. This product made my face GLOW. I have never felt so moisturized and my acne scars from previous cysts that had stubbornly stayed for months have only started to fade since adding this to my routine. I'm tempted to try rubbing it all over my eczema/psoriasis spots on the rest of my body haha. My dry, flakey skin smooths out after applying this in the AM/PM, but after only two weeks my small bottle of phoenix oil is almost gone and I certainly cannot afford more since it is prohibitively expensive. I really want to support this company because I love their ingredients and products, but unfortunately it is just out of my price range :( I'll be crying over my empty bottle in another week on the hunt for a cheaper alternative.",,,,

Nothing was helping but the Blue Clay mask, but I wanted something more convenient to use. I noticed a change in my skin within the first 2 days of using. The red spots are fading and so are the bumps. I'm using less and less concealer everyday and I love that. I was nervous about using it under makeup but my makeup actually lasted longer and my skin is a lot less oily. Hopefully it will continue to get less oily as I use it. I love the glow it gives my skin and the scent is really nice, it may not be for everyone but it's very light. I'm definitely going to try the other oils now!",,,,

I've broken out from facial oils before so I was skeptical about this one, but it really is amazing. Within a week of using it, my breakouts calmed, my skin was less red and the dry patches I always had around my mouth and nose were gone. I also received compliments on my skin from friends and acquaintances who were eager to know what I was using. I haven't touch my prescriptions since and I don't plan to.

I am absolutely totally obsessed with this stuff. First of all, I have extremely dry sensitive fair skin. Prone to redness, irritation, flaking and hormonal breakouts. Prone to all of the things really. But that's not even it.... Also my skin has recently been so oily throughout the day that I have to reset my makeup multiple times. It was getting ridiculous. If I didn't moisturize, I would get so flaky and red. But if I did moisturize my makeup would melt off of my face all day long. Long story short, I work in skincare and have used literally everything. This oil not only calmed my skin down immediately!..... Within one week of use my skin is the best it has been in years. It does everything! It completely tames redness, heals up any blemishes, is AHMAZING under makeup too!.... I literally cannot say enough. I am completely hooked and obsessed!!",,,,

I use this product once daily after washing my face with the pink clay bar soap (not immediately after). My skin has never looked or felt better. The smell alone is to die for! And I've only had it for about two weeks. I can't wait to see the long-term results. Don't stress over the price - this beauty is worth every penny. I'm never going back to anything else ever.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-03-21,My New Favorite,"I had read a few articles and product reviews of this product and decided to give it a try. I've been using it now for over a week and it does exactly what I need it to do. 
My skin is acne prone and I always wear sunscreen during the day. My plan for this oil was to use by itself and as an additive to my sunscreen and it works both ways like a charm. 
I'm 37 years old and have been using oils for years in an attempt to replenish suppleness and combat wrinkles. They really work and I think I have found my new favorite line. 
I will be purchasing Phoenix oil next to use at night.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-03-15,The benefits will show immediately.,"I ordered this oil with the Blue Clay (I got the Blue Tansy instead, I guess they mistaken that for the other but it's okay) to rescue my oily and acne prone skin. 
This Lapis Oil that is supposed to control oil truly works and moisturize my skin.
I could already tell by the first day of use!

Although I needed to pay custom fees plus expensive shipping here in Italy (that costed me 50€ to get these goodies home)
I really wish they had them in Sephora.it or physical stores in Milan. 

I hope they last me a long time before I need to repurchase!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-03-13,Amazing,This product has completely cleared my skin.

I use it in combination with the charcoal soap and my skin has never looked better!!!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-02-25,Blown Away.,"Let me start off by saying that I have dry/dehydrated skin with eczema on my eyelids and neck (how lovely). I am prone to congestion on my chin, but really no issues with acne. Since this oil is targeted for more oilier skin types, I thought this oil would be very light and wouldn't help my dry, flaky skin.. WRONG. This has made my face so soft and plump, I'm not even joking. I am super sensitive and I have had no reaction to this oil. For the record, I have never had a reaction from any HB product. I am just in love. The blue color just adds to the beautiful experience with this oil. Also, my face has been recovering from a reaction that I had to a new face wash; flaky, bright red, and very tight with a uncomfortable burning sensation around my nose and cheeks. The Phoenix and Orchid oils really helped my skin to get back to normal (I didn't have the lapis oil at the time). I can't brag enough about this product. I will for sure be buying the full size bottle.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2016-02-22,What a relief,"I was still warming up to the use of facials oils and this one specifically it was converted me to a true believer. I get pimples on my forehead from stress and certain (bad/unhealthy) foods, as well as a few here and there on my cheeks from the changing seasons, and I swear Lapis really balances and helps heal and maybe even prevent. I'm two weeks in and have been using this one in rotation with the other two oils, as well as my other products, and I will be coming back for more when I run out. It's fab.",,,,

It is nice and light enough that I can use it during the daytime (especially with my combination/dry/sensitive winter skin).

Even after a couple days of using the Lapis Facial Oil my skin feels super balanced and that is no easy task. I am always struggling to balance my skin between all my dry patches, redness and the occasional breakout and this product finally is doing that for me. Also you can wear under makeup (just rub in thoroughly and let dry). Most facial oils I have encountered do not wear well under makeup but the Lapis Oil is amazing for day or night and under makeup it doesn't get creasy.",,,,

I never dealt with acne, I'm 27years old and after a bad birth control prescription all hell broke loose. I'm ashamed to same I spent hundreds of dollars on products with no real results. I finally found a good skincare line that has really helped with inflammation and calming down the giant cystic pimples that would pop up daily. Then I came across herbivores on Instagram and decided to add to my routine. I've only been using this oil for a few days and even though I've been getting good results with my skincare routine this has taken it over the top. My makeup applies better, the redness around my chin has gone down, and even the scarring left behind from the cystic acne have started to lighten. I use this at night before applying my moisturizer and I'm really impressed. My acne products can be drying so this gives great moisture and really radiates my skin.",,,,

The smell did take a little getting used to but in the end, I came to love it (I actually look forward to using it). The oil is calming yet effective on dry spots, without being overly oily.

Already I have seen a huge difference in my facial redness and the most amazing thing is I no longer need to use an oil absorbing powder during the day numerous times - absolutely amazing! And these results are just in 2 weeks! Today I am ordering the Tansy Face mask and another Lapis roller to give to my mother who for the first time in my life told me my skin looked beautiful last week....once again, absolutely amazing! Thank you!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,5,2015-11-03,Amazing!,"I absolutely love this product! I have combination skin- oily in the T-zone and dry on my cheeks and forehead. I put this on at night after using the Balance Toner. I wake up glowing- my skin even, and properly moisturized without being greasy. I can even tell when I put my makeup on. I spritz some of the toner on again with a cotton pad and then put my makeup on and I still have a nice glow. A girl with combination skin can tell the difference between glowy and oily and this stuff balances me out perfectly. Definitely going to buy the full-size!",,,,

To say the ol' self esteem took a blow would be a serious understatement. Then Lapis Oil to the rescue! I've been using the product for 8 months now and swear by it! After 3 months of using on a daily basis...I haven't (knock on wood) had one single ridiculous cyst on my face! Also...any other little adult acne has dissipated! Seriously PRAISE for Lapis!!!

I have combination-oily skin that usually becomes oily within an hour or two, so I figured this oil would be the most suitable of the three for me. I've been using this product for a week, and it has already made such a dramatic improvement in my skin. I applied the oil at 8:30 this morning, and by 4:30 in the afternoon there was no sign of any oil on my face - not even on my chin or nose, where it tends to be the most oily. My chin in particular is very acne-prone, and I have been noticing fewer breakouts there since I started using this product. 100% recommend.",,,,

I tried the 3 small ones to see what it was all about. The Lapis seems to work the best for me but the other 2 are really just as good and the phoenix is good for the evening and I know I'm using more than I need to but I just love them! I'm hooked.

But this stuff has taken the redness out of his skin, gotten rid of the dry-flakies, shrunk his pores, and helped a little with seasonal eczema. Oh, and he is having far fewer breakouts, too.

It has been great for my oily skin and keeps me very hydrated. I have been able to tell my complexion is smoother and more even since wearing this oil. It's very lightweight, non greasy, and only takes a few drops (4-6) for your whole face. This product should last me at least a year. The smell is lovely. The blue tansy is the strongest component, in my opinion. It's fragrance is somewhat minty and therapeutic. It's not overpowering at all. If you are familiar with May Lindstrom, the scent will remind you of her ""Blue Cacoon."" I'm a huge fan of May's and have several of her products and adore them but in my opinion, this is more hydrating than the Blue Cacoon and not to mention, a better value. This is a must have, a go-to, a holy grail. Lapis oil will be replacing all my other oils. Thank you Herbivore Botanicals for creating something both beautiful and effective!",,,,

I don't have a beard, but I do have the occasional stubble-- and the oil seems to sit on top of the hairs instead of absorbing into that area of my face. I take a good five minutes to massage a quarter of the applicator's worth of product into my face and down my neck.

IT WORKED OVER NIGHT. I noticed improved skin texture, redness, and my acne was almost gone. After only three days I was getting compliments on my skin because they have never seen my skin so clear. THIS IS NO JOKE.

I use this after my moisturizer, as the very last step in my nighttime skincare routine, and for once in life since I was a pre-teen, my skin isn’t an oily greasy mess! I wake up with normal skin each morning, and I’m no longer dripping oil everywhere throughout the day. My skin is balanced and healthy, and my acne is healing so quickly too.

People always think I look about 10+ years younger, and I really believe that’s because I use my own simple homemade products (i.e., organic sugar for exfoliation, lemon for brightness, homemade colloidal silver for glow and anti microbial properties, rose water with neroli and frankincense for a toner, and goat milk, licorice root, oat flour, and rice bran flour as a mild exfoliation and glow facial wash) and many of the Herbivore products such as: pink cloud face wash, prism, bakuchiol, cloud jelly, nova, emerald, orchid or phoenix facial oil, pink cloud moisturizer, moon fruit, prism face mask, brighten face mask, and tansy face mask). I’m a Certified Holistic Nutritionist so what I put in and on my body is important to me. Many of my friends and family pick my brain for what I do and any time there is makeup talk, I’m always told not to put anything on my skin because it is perfect, and I hands down applaud Herbivore for that. I’m new to using Nova but immediately felt like my skin just soaked it in and felt more hydrated and plump — can’t wait to see the results over long term use.

For years I've suffered from large pores, hormonal acne, combination skin, and just general unevenness of skintone/texture on my face. I saw this in an ad and bought the sample bottle to try. I've applied three drops (forehead and each cheek) morning and evening for the last month and a half or so, and let me just say, nothing - not even prescription cleansers/creams - has ever come close to what Lapis has done for me. Within a week, my skintone and texture had evened to the point where I stopped wearing foundation. My skin is smooth, pores are less visible, and the color is even and has a certain healthy glow to it that it's never had before. Since I've started using it, I have had zero acne. None. Not a single pimple, hormonal or otherwise. Oiliness has improved. It may be a bit drying in a couple areas, but it's not bad at all. Overall, I am extremely impressed (and boggled) by this stuff.

I am someone who gets acne from any skincare product regardless of formulation. Anti-acne, sensitive, etc... will absolutely give me acne and I had basically given up looking at skincare because I was so tired of having acne and everything just made it so much worse. When I saw this product I was very interested in trying it but the price tag made me stall for a bit because in my mind why would I pay that much to give myself more acne. Finally breaking down considering the incredible reviews this product has gotten, I splurged on the big bottle. I could have bought the mini or the smaller bottle to try the product without spending so much, but on the chance that this product worked I wanted the full size and WOW, am I glad I bought the big  bottle! Within the first week I was in love with this oil. I was in the shower noticing that all the small milia bumps and clogged pores trapped under the skin were completely gone, just GONE! The second week I noticed that the light rosacea I have was also diminished by I'd say 95% and my pores and the spaces between the pores looked so much better than they ever have in my entire life I wanted to cry actual tears of joy because I feel so good about my skin now. This oil is so light and airy, it completely sinks into my skin within minutes and does not leave me feeling even a little bit greasy. Some people complained about the 'medicinal' smell, but once it's dry I don't smell it at all and it's just camphor in the blue tansy that you're smelling so it's not an unnatural fragrance. Knock on wood, in the three weeks of once daily use(the bottle says do it twice, but I only do it once before bed after toning with witch hazel) of this oil I have not gotten a single pimple. If I noticed a bump, it was not red and it disappeared within a day. I am looking in a mirror now which is what encouraged me to make this review because I can't believe the difference this product made on my skin. If you have doubts if this product will work for you, try it anyways. I am so glad I tried this, it has literally changed my life and skin in such a quick time frame I'm still shocked it can even be real.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2022-01-14,It actually really works better than most products I've tried!,"I'm in my mid 30s with combination skin prone to all the different kinds of acne - whiteheads, blackheads, cystic, hormonal, eczema, etc. I've been breaking out since I was 10. My mother had acne. My brother has severe acne. I tried every over the counter product sold for the past 20+ yrs, been to dozens of dermatologist appointments (that made my skin the worst, ironically), tried many prescriptions. Nothing ever worked, most products make my skin worse. 

A few months ago I stumbled upon this. I bought it on a whim along with a dozen other new products.  Out of everything new I bought/tried, and out of everything I tried in years past, this stuff works the best. The scent is lovely. It hydrates your skin without feeling greasy or shiny. I even tried a similar blue tansy serum from a different company and it did nothing compared to this Lapis serum (I think the other company diluted their serum too much). My whiteheads/blackheads have reduced by over 60% in just under 2 months. Cystic and hormonal acne is almost nonexistent, and the breakouts I do have heal completely in just a few days instead of the weeks/months they took to heal before. Pores/scars are greatly diminished. My skin looks the best it has in years. Inflammation from clogged pores shrinks down to almost nothing. It somehow hydrates my dry cheeks without greasing up my T zone. I feel like my skin would be happy just using this alone, though I do layer it with other products. I use benzoyl peroxide once every 2-3 days first, or a ""buffer"" serum with hylauronic acid and peptides. Then I use Lapis - about 5-6 drops on my face and 2-3 on my neck and chest. Then I use a moisturizer (on dry days) or sunscreen. Then I top it off with a few drops of either one of a couple of ""barrier building""-type pore minimizing/anti inflammatory serums/moisturizers I've been experimenting with, though I keep noticing that THIS serum is the key each day. The others products I use don't have as immediate and drastic results. My skin never looked so good without makeup. My skin tone seems even and healthy, not patchy and blotchy like before. I immediately bought a 2nd bottle after a week of using this, and now it's almost 2 months and I've used 1/10th of the first bottle. It's pricy. but VERY worth it.

I NAILED it, this is fan-freakin- tastic. I didn't know i needed help w acne as it was so minimal I (again) assumed it was from my mask. But no. . . So anyway, that's all fixed up.

I have tricky skin. I get small zits and clogged pores, but nothing cystic. The zits turn to little scabs that seem to never heal. It can take over a month sometimes, and I hate it. Unfortunately my skin is also extremely dry, but whenever I try to add moisture I break out more. I don't even want to think about how much money I've spent over the years buying products that haven't worked. Lately the flaky skin has been awful on my nose due to wearing masks. I have raw patches on my nose that seem to never heal, just continually flake.

I started using one drop each of the Phoenix, Emerald, and Lapis oils after my moisturizer at night. In the morning I do the same thing, but before my moisturizer because that one has SPF and I don't want to rub it away.

My skin has changed DRAMATICALLY in only 3 days! Zero new zits, my skin absolutely glows, and my scabs/raw patches have already healed so much! I'm 31 and starting to get some fine lines on my forehead, and they're already less noticeable. I think it's because of how well this oil is hydrating and plumping my skin.

Lapis is a holy grail product for me. Smells incredible, and clears my acne while hydrating my skin at the same time.

I'm so relieved to have found these products that I want to cry. I'm finally on my way to the skin I've always wanted. The oil is very rich and concentrated, so don't be scared of the cost. It goes a long way. I have the mini, and I can tell that tiny bottle will last about 2 months.",,25-34,Combination,"Acne, Dryness, Dullness, Sensitivity, Anti-aging"

My daughter had been injured on her face and I researched oils rather intensively to find the best one to help her heal both faster, and to prevent it from becoming a scar.  This led me to the blue tansy oil, and over time, as she healed, with hardly a sign of her injury in a most miraculous way, the side effect was her complexion became clearer as well.  I ended up putting both my husband and myself on the oil as well, and this stuff just works!!! The sandalwood in conjunction with it, is like the dynamic duo that calms redness that can appear as rosacea or just flat out high color in those who exhibit high emotion, like myself, because I have kids and life and stress happens to affect my skin color ;)  (think Princess Diana who had to have green makeup on her wedding day to cover her redness from high emotion).  At any rate, this works best used in very small amounts after first spritzing with a mist/toner of preferred type and then lightly patted in everywhere. In drier parts of the country, or wintertime with drier environments then more may be used, but in humid parts of the country, less will be more.

My skin felt softer and smoother and the large pores near my nose were visibly smaller. Plus, as promised, my skin was significantly LESS oily in the morning.

My aesthetician insists to never put oil on my face but I have defied her for this bottle. 

I started using lapis and ended up breaking out everywhere. I couldn't tell if I were purging or having a bad reaction. So I decided to get a full facial extraction and only use the oil on one side to properly test its effects. Four days later, I ended up with my usual whiteheads on the oil-free side and my lapis side was glowing with much less whiteheads. Overall, impressive but expect to purge.

Although even on the antibiotics and creams and I would break out along my jawline and it didn't seem like the medication could do anything. With the lapis oil I see more of a result, also faster result, than I did with anything else I have used. My skin is still oily but it did help clear up my skin.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,4,2016-08-14,Tricky Oil,"I really struggled with this oil! I have an oily T-zone with larger pores and a chin that likes to break out monthly, you know what I mean. I would never ever call any part of my skin dry or say I had true acne. I bought the roller ball set of all 3 oils. 

When I first used this oil, I would apply it all over my T-zone to help ward of oil during the day, along with the Pheonix Oil around my face and apply moisturizer over the top. It dried out my skin near my eyes and me cheeks so bad I thought I was having an allergic reaction. It looked like hives. I'm allergic to Ragweed so it's possible I could have reacted to the related Blue Tansy/Chamomile. 

After a LOT of trail and error I have found this oil only works OVER moisturizer for me. Now my routine is thus: Phenonix everywhere, Orchid on drier areas like cheeks or breakouts, eye cream, cream moisturizer THEN Lapis oil on t-zone, breakouts or irritated skin. 

Now that I have it figured out, the anti-inflammatory properties have really gone to work and have actually helped to heal the spots it had previously been irritating. 

If you're struggling with not making the product work for you or feel like it's making your skin worse, I highly suggest changing the order of your products. Skincare isn't one size fits all.",,,,

Since this is the only thing I changed since last winter, I'm crediting this product. It is supposed to be purifying, so maybe it's a little too drying for my sensitive skin during the winter. I'll put it away until spring/summer and use it only during the warmer months when my skin needs less hydration and more purification.

my skin improved very slightly for a while, but after about a month it returned to its former state and has consistently been acne prone. i also developed small bumps around my smile lines that were colorless, but irritating.

i do have dry skin, and the lapis oil has been great for hydration. i do not think it is effective at treating acne, especially not blackheads.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,1,2018-04-04,Dissapointed :(,I initially liked it and enjoyed adding an oil to my skincare routine. I used it with the moonfruit cream at night. After a few days my skin was feeling so soft and hydrated but I was getting red spots all over my face and in places I didn't normally break out. I tried using the lapis oil with other moisturizers day and night but my skin only started clearing after I stopped using it.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,1,2018-04-02,Smells awful,I'm not sure why anyone is saying it smells fantastic. Mine was bought at Sephora and has the most awful smell. Like moldy cheese garlic.,,,,

I purchased this due to the glowing reviews and hoped it would help with my remaining acne.. but surprise my cystic acne is back!!!! extremely disappointed with this facial oil.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,1,2017-12-11,Be Warned...Broke Out my Sensitive Skin,"I'm 22 and have sensitive acne-prone skin that gets dry in the winter. I started using this oil several weeks ago at bedtime and before makeup application in the morning. First of all, it is incredibly greasy and my skin does not easily soak it up even when I massage it for several minutes. I had only minor redness and a couple active pimples before I started my new regimen with lapis. Fast forward two weeks, and I'm suffering the worst breakouts of my life- incredibly painful, swollen red zits. This is definitely the culprit, as it's the only new skincare product I've used. I exfoliate with AHAs semi-regularly, and would apply this oil after a lightweight face cream. This is not a product I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,1,2017-11-30,"Too Bad, Lapis oil Breaks me Out :(","I was excited to try out this lapis oil. I read so many good feedback and review about it before I made a purchase. I’m not usually write reviews but I feel the need to write one this time because I’m really disappointed. .

I used the oil day and night before my regular moisturizer for 5 days in a row now and I noticed increase in acne. I have cystic acne on my jawline and a lot of whiteheads around my nose and forehead. I have a really bumpy skin texture on my forehead and nose now. I’m sure this oil clogged my pores. This lapis oil and blue tansy mask are the only change I made in my skincare routine. I used another facial oil in the past and it never breaks me out like this. It’s amazing how it destroyed my skin in 5 days. 

It’s ashamed that this lapis oil was especially advertised for oily/acne-prone skin but it creates more problems for me. As much as I want it to work, I will not recommend this lapis oil for people with acne-prone skin. It might work with people with dry and non sensitive skin.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,1,2017-04-19,Terrible Company.,"I warn everyone to not buy from this company. I had a terrible experience, wrote a review about it, and they deleted it immediately. They con people into thinking their products are beyond amazing because they delete anything negative, so my question is: are all the good reviews even real?",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,1,2017-04-18,ABSOLUTELY did NOT work for me!,"After reading pages and pages of excellent reviews on this Lapis Oil, I decided to suck it up and spend the money in order to see perfectly clear skin, but this oil did the opposite for me. I was beyond excited for this beautiful product and was so sad it made my skin worse than it had ever been. I have dry skin that tends to break out around my period. I was hoping this oil would smooth out my complexion and keep the hormonal acne at bay. The first few days using it my face was fine, then I would wake up every morning with a new zit or a few new zits. I continued to use it thinking maybe this is the initial stage before my skin gets used to it and the oil starts working miracles, but it didnt. It also made my blackheads unmanageable and the worst they have been in my entire life! I used it was a little over a month, just hoping and praying it would somehow turn around, but I have officially given up. As soon as I stopped using it, the whiteheads and zits stopped appearing so I know it was the oil because that is all I had changed in my regime. I hate that I spent $72 on a facial oil that makes my skin even worse and causes me to break out daily. Thats a lot of money to pay for terrible skin!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/lapis-facial-oil-mini,1,2016-08-12,Did Nothing For My Skin,"As a college student wanting beautiful skin and beautiful things, I saved up and bought this after reading all of the reviews, thinking it would help with my closed comedones and acne. Not only did it not clear up any of my clogged pores, but it made my actual acne more irritated and created larger ""under the surface"" pimples. I get that it won't work for everyone, but I'm pretty disappointed in having thrown away $72+. I bought $8 100% argan oil and that has done more for my skin than this.",,,,

It seems to reduce the dark circles around my eyes, reduces the fine lines and gives me back a healthy glow without wearing foundation or a highlighter. 

Also, when something went wrong with shipping (it arrived only half full), I was helped finding a good solution the same day. Excellent service.

All together: I highly reccomend this product as well as the Herbivore company!",,,,

I finally grabbed the Phoenix oil to see if it would help, and I have finally started to see improvement in my lovingly termed “eczema goatee.” Needless to say, I’m quite pleased with this oil! It’s been a great help for getting my skin through winter.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/wrinkle-fighting-duo-moon-fruit-serum-phoenix-face-oil,5,2017-12-14,Most luxurious product ever!,I have dry skin in the winter and combination in the summer and this oil has been a life saver for my dull flakey winter skin. It literally makes my skin glow and leaves me feeling super moisturized without the greasy feeling some oils can leave behind. Heavy enough to combat my irritable dry patches while still being light enough to use when I get hormonal breakouts. I'm in love.,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/wrinkle-fighting-duo-moon-fruit-serum-phoenix-face-oil,5,2017-06-19,More Than Expected!,"Although at first I had a few breakouts from this product -- which is not at all uncommon with my skin (combination, prone to hairline and t-zone breakouts) -- once my skin adapted to the new oil, the results were beautiful. After applying a base oil, I use this one for touchups. It goes along my cheekbones, on any lingering acne scars, on the bow of my lip, and under my eyes. Then I let it take its time to soak in and reap the rewards! It delivers on the moisture and for me at least had two unexpected benefits: longer eyelashes and softened scars. Highly recommended! 

For those curious, I typically use either Thayer's Witch Hazel toner or Herbivore Rose Hibiscus Mist first, let that dry, then massage in Herbivore Jasmine Body Oil or plain grapeseed oil in a pinch, before applying Phoenix oil.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/wrinkle-fighting-duo-moon-fruit-serum-phoenix-face-oil,5,2017-05-20,Incredible,"I started using Herbivore in January after I wasn't seeing the results I wanted from other expensive brands and wanting to switch to a more natural plant based product. I fell in love after the first week!

This oilhas helped reduce my redness and fine lines. I have sensitive skin and it is not bothered by Phoenix, but made beautiful and soft!

I love the rich smell and texture. I let my face tell me how much I need. A little goes a long way! I have noticed a big difference in fine lines when i use this as an eye moisturizer. It doesn't bother my eyes at all and has helped even out my dark circles and tiny wrinkles.

I now have a skincare ritual I look forward to every evening. Nightly I wash with pink clay soap, alternate with blue tansy and brighten, use the pink clay mask twice a week, then apply moon fruit and either lapis or phoenix.

My skin has tightened, has a nice glow and I rarely have to use foundation (unless I'm feeling fancy)...highly recommend!",,,,

The old brand I used began to discontinue my favorite products and going on a different direction so I was yet again on a search for an effective organic skincare regimen. After trialing 4-5 brands in the last half year, I stumbled upon herbivore, which has really complimented my skin. The whole line has been extraordinary the last two weeks but the Phoenix oil is the breadwinner. It goes on very light and absorbs into the skin within 20 minutes depending on how many drops you use. But it's also so nourishing and leaves the skin supple without clogging it. Who knew a quality oil could take the place of cream!",,,,

I'm constantly jumping from product to product and never ever purchasing any item more than once. 
I'm happy to say this is my second bottle and things are going well. It really is a beautiful oil, the smell is pleasant and it brings a nice glow to my otherwise dull complexion. I also love that there not any filler ingredients, so everything in the bottle serves a purpose for your skin. With a lot of cream moisturizers I feel like I'm paying mostly for water, glycerin, and preservatives. 
I bought this pack because the rollerball is really convenient for traveling.",,,,

You really can't judge a book by its cover in this case! I tried all three oils out by purchasing the roller ball set. ALL 3 oils are incredible and I've been using all 3. I use the Lapis and the Orchid for the day, with the Lapis for my t-zone and the Orchid for my cheeks and jaw area (I have pigmentation there). For the night I use this (Phoenix) along with my anti-aging and repair products. I just wish Sephora had it in-store here in Canada so I can buy it right away and not have to wait for a package!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/wrinkle-fighting-duo-moon-fruit-serum-phoenix-face-oil,5,2017-01-08,Not just for dry/mature skin!,"My skin is dehydrated and is prone to clogged pores on my forehead. My skin is not oily though. In the summer it can get a tad oily if I have makeup on, but other than that, I don't have an oil control issue. This oil is great. It doesn't sit on the skin, it's sinks in so quickly. The rosehip oil in this product has really helped at evening out my skin along with the brighten mask. The mask plus this oil is a dynamic duo. If you're skin isn't overly oily and you are really wanting to try this I would say go for it! They have travel sizes that last longer than you'd think, so that might be a good option. As for now, it hasn't caused any clogged pores or acne. I'm really loving my skin right now. Thank you, herbivore!",,,,

When I use it at night, I just fell very hydrating and absorbed very quickly. The smell are so nice with a note of rose aroma. Also, It's more nature than other facial oil I used. Just fell in love with this oil especially in this winter season. Definitely recommend this one to every one!!",,,,

It wasn't. I did something I have never done before after using Herbivore. I tossed out all of my face wash, toner, serums, and lotions, all of it (some still completely full)! I went back online and ordered more Herbivore product! Thats how good this is. I knew right away everything that I have been doing was wrong for my skin.

 After the second day of use my face was soft, smooth and less oily. After two weeks I noticed the plumpness and youthfulness that I thought only surgery and needles could bring back. 

I use the lapis oil as well, but I use 1 drop of phoenix oil at night around my eyes to keep that thin sensitive skin super moisturized. 

What can I say? I'm in love with Herbivore Phoenix Oil!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/wrinkle-fighting-duo-moon-fruit-serum-phoenix-face-oil,5,2016-07-23,Wow! Great for combo skin!,"Been using it for about 3 wks... Was afraid Phoenix oil would be too oily for my combo skin (age 38) but my face turns out to really enjoy it! I use approx. 4-5 drops each time (morning and night). Now I am addicted to this and even got my mom (dry skin) to use it (daytime for her; she still prefers LaMer at night). 

I've noticed some skin tone improvements but yet to discover any rejuvenation effect or more miracle to happen. I am satisfied so far and no big pores issues as I've experienced before with another brand. 

Phoenix Oil smells good, keeps my face moisturized and comfortable (even under makeup in mornings), and has really simplified my skincare routine. In fact, this is a great alternative (and actually steering me away) from my other expense creams (CDP La Creme).",,,,

She's a knowledgable beauty blogger so her advice I admired, but I was hesitant to switch from my traditional luxe face cream to an oil. Living in Arizona with intense heat, an oil sounded messy - but regardless I took a chance with Herbivore.

It's the best decision I've made in my beauty regime all year. Phoenix is my new favorite product! My skin soaks it in beautifully, and the oil is so pleasant in touch and smell, I feel like royalty applying it. I look forward to using it every night.

It is definitely more even toned, smoother, firmer and feels and looks beautiful. I can't tell you enough how wonderful this product is. When I was younger, my skin was oily and has remained so until about a year ago. So, this was really a challenge for me, as I'm not used to dealing with dryer skin. (My skin still would in no way be described as dry, but for me, it is.) I have tried other facial oils - jojoba and rose oil, to be exact and they were really unimpressive. This - I will never be without this product. It is worth every single penny. By the way, I just turned 60 - if that helps anyone. Thank you, Herbivore for making this product!!",,,,

It feels lush, it goes on smoothly and soaks right into your skin. The scent is very fresh and not overpowering, but of course that is subjective. I use it twice a day under my moisturizer to really lock in long-lasting hydration, but I could see using this alone/on top of a moisturizer. It's perfect for this dry winter weather.

Of course she wanted to know what I used...when I told her, she said ""Oh"" and walked away... ahem.....

Especially thick oils! I cannot stand greasy or oily feelings from anything. I’ve even skipped lotion from time to time and I have combination skin, that is a little sensitive. I bought Herbivores travel sizes in the skin clarifying duo with the blue tansy mask and the lapis oil and the glow+hydrate with this Phoenix oil and I also got a deluxe sample size of the emerald hemp oil. It took me a long time to figure out which one was my favorite, lol because they all address different things. The hemp oil helps to calm any redness or irritation but it’s the thinnest out of the 3, in yet it still offers a ton of hydration. The lapis oil helps to balance sebum production, hydrates, heals acne and acne scars. The Phoenix oil hydrates the most, helps even skin tone, soothes irritation, hydrates and helps heal acne scars. Phoenix is my favorite because of the subtle (not overpowering) rose scent. I cannot even wear perfume because it causes headaches and all of the oils have amazing subtle scents! The lapis smells the strongest, though, like blue tansy. I overdo facials because I have a ton of time on my hands and love how I feel after doing them but I do them too often and it dries my skin out. After I started using these oils it hydrated my skin and kept it balanced, no acne, no blackheads, no irritation. I mean they just healed my skin completely. My skin does not feel oily with these on my face even after I apply serum and moisturizer first!!!! It feels dewy, loose and hydrated and so comfortable!! It takes some time to soak into the skin but once it does it is the best my face has ever felt in my life!! I even ran out for a week and my face was DYING!!! It felt so tight and dry, I could not take it! I bought another travel size of the hydrate and glow because I love the rose mist and the gemstone mask!! I definitely think atleast 1 herbivore facial oil is essential in anybody’s skin care routine because they are just made to heal skin.

The glass bottle and logo is beautiful and luxurious.

However if I'm going to pay 90 dollars for a product, of any sort, I'd expect a better dropper. I don't know if mine was just defective, but the oil came out the seems of the dropper since day one.

This Phoenix oil is lightweight and absorbs instantly, not leaving any kind of film or residue. A little goes a long way. It instantly hydrates and keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day. The roller is super convenient, I apply it directly to my face. The scent is great, it's a refreshing addition to my morning routine!

While this oil is great for gentle hydration, I haven't noticed any improvement to the quality of my skin. This product claims reduction in fine lines/wrinkles, premature aging prevention, and overall restoration/revitalization, but so far I haven't experienced any results to my skin's appearance.

I then immediately washed my face and neck and when I woke up the next morning my eyes were swollen and puffy (but not terribly) I was still able to go to work the next day.

There is very little information or warning on the website or in the box. I don’t want this happen to someone else! Two mistakes I made, could have been prevented if there was more information provided. It is not true that it’s so gentle you can Jsut start using it twice a day as the bottle says. It also does make your skin photosensitive! Despite a few online resources that say it doesn’t. Again NO info on this product page or the box!! So I put it on at night. The next morning, skin seemed good, I put on for am. Maybe that second application was my mistake. The next mistake was going outside in the sun with a wide brimmed hat for two hours in the morning. Later that evening my face began to feel like sandpaper. I washed my face, applied some aloe leaf because it seemed the gentlest thing. The next morning my face and neck were covered in sandpaper bumps! And a little swollen. Much like a retinol purge when you start too fast or go in the sun. Miserably itchy and hot and also I look awful of course. The next morning my eyes were starting to swell (did not apply near eyes). This will take weeks to disappear and has ruined my plans for the week, buts it’s also just miserably uncomfortable. I had a retinol purge twice in my life but never ever like this.

Because my skin was getting clearer I figured I could try some products to help with the scarring (I have horrible acne scars that have left my skin with horrible scars that look like purple bruises all over my face.) I really loved the sound of this product, as it contains neroli oil which is used to lighten scars and promote cell turnover. I bought this small size because I was not about to spend 80 dollars on something that may not have worked for my skin. I used the product for maybe 3-4 days. I will say quickly, the product is beautiful. Package, smell, color..gorgeous. However, after only a few short days, I got 3 cystic pimples...I quickly stopped using the product.

I have struggled with pretty bad cystic acne, with skin that is extremely dry, while also sometimes being oily. My skin couldn't make up it's mind if it's little pores depended on it. I feel like I have tried everything over the years, from cheap to expensive. I have spent a good part of my life trying out what works best for my skin. I started using this because I found a video that recommended the mask. Feeling hella lame about myself because my face looked like a big red mess (as per usual), I caved in and bought the smaller set just to try it out. Now ladies and gents, I have breakouts basically EVERY day. It has been probably years since I didn't get at least one new pimple a day or every other day. DAY ONE of using this product I noticed an immediate change in the way my skin felt and looked. I IMMEDIATELY stopped getting breakouts and didn't have another breakout for OVER A WEEK. My cystic pimples haven't come back since. I have had just a few pimples since I started this product about a month ago, but they actually go away and they aren't big angry ones. I know you're probably sitting there reading this, much like I did, thinking this is too good to be true. I certainly can't speak for everyone, because everyone's skin is different, but I will never be without this product ever again. I use this one in the morning, and I picked up the Emerald CBD Oil as well and I use that one at night (also a fantastic product). I have never felt this confident bout my skin. I almost left the house without make-up the other day....almost...I haven't even given that idea a thought since I was a freakin kid. My dudes, this is worth the money.

I have combination, sensitive, textured, and acne-prone skin that I can usually control very well with diet. I had been using a good quality Jojoba oil and a couple different gentle cleansers for years with okay results but it wasn’t anything spectacular. I got a hormonal breakout all over my face and back after I had my daughter last year and ordered this lapis oil and the charcoal bar cleanser as I’d been looking at this brand for a while, and holy moly. Within days my skin started to clear up and look SO smooth, balanced, and soft, and my persistent redness and irritation just melted away. I didn’t review right away because I wanted to make sure it wasn’t a temporary initial reaction. I’ve now been using this combination for over a year and it’s still my holy grail! I’ve only purchased 2 bottles of the lapis (and I still have months left on my second bottle) which is pretty great for daily application for 14 months, so don’t be unnerved by the price. I recommend this to everyone I know and I’ve given samples to a few friends and my sister and they are all obsessed! 

Notes: I don’t use the lapis oil on my back, just on my face and neck. I do use the charcoal cleanser on both face and back.

For years I struggled with oily skin until I learned that actually means my skin is dry and therefore, overproducing oil. This keeps my skin hydrated but not oily. It absorbs and does not make me break out at all! I remember reading reviews a while back when I first tried the product that some people were struggling with breakouts or other bad reactions... with every product there are always going to be people who have skin that does not react well. You cannot compare your skin to someone else's. Request a sample and see if this works for you. If it does, it'll change your life like it did mine!!!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2019-07-29,Tears of joy!,"I’ve been struggling with fungal acne for almost 8 months now. I have an illness that throws off the PH in my body and in return causes me to break out. I switched up my whole routine to KBeauty products. I’ve been seeing an improvement, but not as much as I’d like. I decided to buy the Blue Tansy mask and I could not believe the results I received from just one use. Clearer, more even toned skin. I decided to stop being afraid of using facial oil on my combo/acne prone skin and try the lapis oil once and for all. I’ve been using it for 2 days and I cannot believe the improvement in my skin. I had a giant pimple on my cheek which was very inflamed as well as some fungal acne on my chin and forehead. They are almost completely gone! I woke up today in happy tears. If you struggle with acne you know the toll it can take on your self-esteem. This oil is my holy grail. There’s no way I’m even removing it from my skincare routine. I can’t wait to use it with the blue tansy mask tonight and see the results in the am. Thank you for creating the perfect product for me!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2019-06-19,MUST HAVE,"I have been using this oil religiously since the end of January. When I began using it in the mini clarify set, my skin was angry, irritated, and broken out. I immediately saw results specifically with this oil, prism, and the blue tansy mask. My breakouts cleared faster and the overall health of my skin was so much better. For the first time in my life, my skin glows! Through the past few months, if I stray from this oil, my skin freaks out. Lapis oil calms my skin like nothing else I’ve ever used. I still break out around my time of the month, but with this oil, my face is less red and irritated and my break outs heal more quickly. I will repurchase this product forever!! Thank you, Herbivore! 💙",,,,

This face oil has completely transformed my skin and I will never use anything else again! I wanted an oil I could wear during the day that absorbed well so I could wear makeup on top. I was using Emerald but it was too oily for daytime use. These ingredients are puuuuure magic. I have sensitive, acne-prone, oily skin and this product has done wonders. It's calming, moisturizing and I truly believe it has even changed the texture/tone of my skin! Now I'm dying to try the mask that coincides with the oil...

I have combination skin, but I struggle with terrible hormonal acne and I always breakout around that time of the month. I use the lapis oil nightly in combination with the prism glow potion.

I was a little thrown at first because when I first applied it, it felt very oily, and not in a way that you want your skin oils to feel.

This stuff is amazing almost so I kinda don’t wanna let the secrect of how amazing it is out ! At first I was afraid to use it on my already oily, hormonal acne prone skin. Took me about a month to use it but I finally took the leap ...soooo glad I did. I have been using lapis oil ( daily) along with the blue tansy mask( twice a week) , retinol a rx strength( every 3 days ) , a good moisturizer( daily ) and a at home micro needling kit( 3 times a week) And my skin has totally done a 360. Before I was having breakouts daily, multiple cystic acne spots . Now I maybe have 1-2 blackheads pop up a week and I spot treat them with lapis or the mask and they are gone the next morning. I cannot rave enough about this product. The price it totally worth it if it means I can go acne free !",,,,

Whereas many face creams just sit on my face, the Lapis absorbs wonderfully and helps my complexion look more even. Moreover, many face creams will cause irritation and tearing if I happen to rub a bit of it near my eyes, but I have not had this problem with Lapis. Now that I am nearing the end of the bottle, I'll be buying myself some more. One note: the dropper has stopped working recently.",,,,

Lapis: This and the Blue Tansy work REALLY well together! I was very impressed how fast the results were. It sounded too good to be true when I spoke to other people about this product in the past as it is always sold out. I have had this product for now 3 years.

After making it through my teen years with clear skin, I developed horrible cystic acne in my early twenties(thanks birth control).I’ve been on literally every product for troubled skin, including proactive and accuntane. These things helped clear my skin up, but in the end led to my current struggle with rosacea and eczema. Lapis oil is the answer! After a recent breakout of dry peeling red bumps all over my nose and cheeks(rosacea babes holla!) I bought the sample size and within a week my skin was clear. I have been to countless dermatologists trying to get to the bottom of my skin issues and nothing has helped as much as this simple, delightful oil. What is it?!? Unicorn tears?!?!

I have Hispanic olive toned skin so it’s oily. I have PTSD so I have high levels of cortisol/stress therefore I’ve been newly blessed with hormonally imbalanced cystic acne. 
Another thing I’m not too excited to share, is that I have Dermatillomania or Excoriation Disorder. If you don’t know what it is, it’s pretty awful and means that I pick at my skin in relation to excessive stress to a pretty horrible point of damage to my skin. The acne makes this struggle a lot more difficult. I have had this since I was eight years old, but it’s much worse now.

ANYWAYS. The purpose of sharing this...
I am on the road to recovery for both my PTSD and skin picking, and let me tell you, this oil HEALS. Excess sebum? Gone. Pimples/Acne? Disappearing. Scarring? Healing. Texture? Soft and glowing but NOT oily. 

A few drops goes a long way. This has become my facial and moisturizer all in one. I also (as my skin reconciled itself from the pre-Lapis damage, used the Blue Clay for spot treatment overnight to speed up the healing of the cystic acne I already had. After the first day I was like, woah.

NEVER stop making this Herbivore.

As a teenager I suffered from a ance, then my ance turned into a puzzling rash that dermatologist could not figure out ever after taking a chunk off my face for biopsy which came out inconclusive. For those 10 years I have tried ever possible oral pill and cream, (aside from accutane due to the long list of side effects and birth control because my rash is not hormonal). Currently I am taking cephalexin and spirolactone, these pills have changed my life, but I still suffered from redness, oilyness and small belishes. After discovering Herbivore Botanicals from a social media influencer I was orignally intrigued simply by the color of the product, so I decided to pay a little more than I usually would for a face product. I can tell you with results that I am so pleased with this product, A couple weeks ago I ran out of Lapis, the redness returned as well as oily skin and small blemishes. I then restocked and continued to us it and now my skin looks better than ever.

We both have very very sensitive skin (one of the main reasons I decided to become and esthetician) and this product has not irritated either of us one bit. It’s incredible.

I used a Blue Tansy balm from the other brand and it's probably too intense for my skin...so my skin broke out a lot. So, I was afraid of using the Lapis oil when I saw the key ingredients.

It.,"You guys... this oil has changed everything I ever thought I knew about skincare in the last 28 years of my life. I've always had acne-prone skin and was always struggling for the right moisturizer that didn't leave me oily, greasy, or with more breakouts. Also, I've tried a couple facial oils in the past and thought that they definitely were NOT for me because they would never absorb properly and I'd be left with sitting oil, causing superficial breakouts in the crevices of my face. Not this one. I'm not exaggerating.. I'm just very impressed. It completely absorbs, and leaves my face feeling soft, DRY (somehow), and actually moisturized -- something I never truly experienced with a cream moisturizer. I'll also add I live in south TX where it's debilitatingly hot and humid most days and this oil has never once made me feel greasy. I am enamored.. I encourage you to try it.",,,,

I have spent thousands of dollars on products and laser treatments but found nothing until I tried the blue tansy and lapis oil duo. I added the pink cloud shortly after and I'm in love with these products. I've found it difficult to find something that provides enough moisture without being too greasy and causing pustules - but I've experienced none since using these products. My dry patches are smoothed, redness has decreased substantially and I'm able to wear only tinted moisturizer instead of globs of cover up. The smell and feel is luxurious and I look forward to putting them on my face. I just purchased the orchid oil to add to my nighttime routine and looking forward to see how that can also change my skin.

I have combo skin that is usually very sensitive to new products but found this to be a very gentle oil. While I still found myself getting the occasional pimple here and there, I did notice that the inflammation/redness was much more subdued before using this, as was the recovery time. It absorbed very quickly and left my skin hydrated while also taming natural oiliness. Living in NYC, I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that holds up to the hot summer heat/humidity without melting off my face so I'm excited to see how this will perform.

Sometimes this is just fine on its own and I don’t need a moisturizer on top, and other days I like a light moisturizer paired with it. This has kept my skin brighter, more clear, and the oil production has reduced. Also, I love that it’s natural with no harsh chemicals.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2017-11-27,This stuff is UH-MAZING!!!!,"I am sooooo glad I tried the Lapis Oil. I’m 39 years old with oily sensitive acne prone skin, I experienced a major breakout on my face and even on my chest. It was awful! In desperation I ordered the Lapis oil because of all the reviews touting it as a miracle in a bottle. I put it on and overnight the inflammation calmed down. Within a week the pimples and cystic acne were almost totally gone. This oil has also promoted healing and I have very little scaring and discoloration left over. 

In the morning I use this oil after I wash my face with the pink clay bar (also amazing), spritz with the Rose Hibiscus toner then apply my serums, then Lapis oil followed by my tinted sunscreen. At night I do essentially the same thing skip the sunscreen and apply my prescription Taxorac cream (which I’ve used for years, but it didn’t prevent or help as much as the Lapis oil with this last breakout).

In addition to helping prevent and heal acne I’ve noticed my face is less oily than before. Normally I’m greasy by 11am, but now my skin is more balanced and looks more dewy than before. Which is awesome because I’ll be 40 in 6 months and my skin looks super healthy.

If you’re on the fence about this oil I encourage you to try it. I rationalized the price point because this oil replaced moisturizers, acne meds and probably acts as a serum too with all it’s amazing ingredients. Plus is works miracles on my sensitive acne prone skin.

Please never ever stop making this stuff!!!",,,,

I have been using this facial oil for a few months now and can totally notice a difference in breakouts when I stop using it. It seems counter intuitive, that not using an oil would mean more acne, but the month that I went without using this, my face broke out and it was painful. The Lapis is soothing, smells amazing, and truly makes me feel like I am caring for my skin at the highest level. I recently started to use it on top of the Moon Fruit, and I am excited to see if I can heal more redness and scarring with the combo.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2017-08-18,An absolute must-have for me.,"I love this stuff. Being severely acne-prone (I'm on topical meds and basically have an insane life routine to avoid massive breakouts) I was very hesitant to try another ""life changing"" face oil since I've been burned in the past. The fact that this is specifically formulated for acne-prone skin is what made me try it, and I'm SO GLAD I did!

The first few days, I tried it at night only and used it ""straight,"" which made my face seem too oily and slightly itchy. I put it back in the cabinet with disappointment. But then I tried it mixed in with my very plain and light moisturizer (3 drops face oil + half a dime size of moisturizer) and BOOM -- dewy, hydrated, and even-toned skin. 

I also did a little science experiment. In a few weeks I got the bright idea to start using the oil on my chest and back too, where I get breakouts. I've noticed a marked difference in those areas as well using JUST the oil, no topical meds or mask. That's proof positive to me that the oil alone is a powerful healing and preventative agent.

Usually my face breaks out like crazy in the summertime no matter what I do. This summer, using this oil and the blue tansy mask, my skin looks better than it has in years. Seriously. Herbivore, please, please never stop making this stuff!",,,,

My skin looks more even, my T zone doesn't get that gross, sticky kind of oily anymore, and the only blemishes I have, are from hormones around my time of the month!!

I have tried many products and have had some temporary success, however, my acne always came back with a vengeance. I started with mild pimples on my forehead, and lately have suffered with large, deep cystic acne on my cheeks, chin, and upper neck. This is the first product I have used that has effectively calmed my acne with no irritation. This product, when combined with the charcoal bar, the blue tansy mask, and rosewater, has worked wonders. For once, I am not waking up with a new pimple to greet me every morning. My skin is by no means perfect now, but after just 1 month I have seen drastic improvement in both my acne and sebum production. It also feels great knowing the ingredients of Herbivore products are so natural. It is expensive, but in my opinion, highly worth the cost. The smell is strong, but does not bother me in the slightest. If you have tried many products and have had little luck, I suggest you give this a try!",,,,

Herbivore Lapis reduced my hormonal acne over night and for the first time, I woke with no new pimples. It's been two weeks and my skin is 100% clear. Clear. Soft. Happy. I use five drops day and night and while it is on the pricier end, it will last a very long time. My only dislike is the smell. However it fades and is gone within 20mins or so.

My mom is an esthetician and has provided me with an array of products to try in my teenage and adult life-time, most of which have not helped me. I purchased the smaller roller-ball of this to just give it a try. I've used the Blue Tansy Mask and have absolutely loved it, but this being an oil made me nervous to put on my hyper-sensitive skin. I've used so many different oils in the past and all have made me react in red, inflamed breakouts. I took the risk and have diligently used this night and day for a while, and I have to say, my skin has cleared up (even during hormonal days), and has become so healthy and dewy looking. The redness is going away, my pores aren't as noticeable, and the oiliness of my skin isn't even an issue anymore. I have been wearing this under my foundation also (after allowing it to fully soak in). Usually 3 hours in, my skin would have become greasy and need to be blotted. Today I put my make up on at 7am, went the entire day until 11pm with the same makeup. Not once did I need to blot my skin, because there was no excess oil, and my makeup still looked great. I think today was the point where I realized how much the Lapis oil has helped me, and how it honestly does what it is described to do. Thank you Herbivore for creating a product that has surpassed all my expectations, where many others have not.

It was going through the withdrawal process (red skin syndrome) and it was sooo red and dried out.

I decided to give this a go, paired with a regular moisturizer afterwards to see if it would help with dryness/redness, and it definitely did! This magic oil has reduced my redness tenfold!

I can't say enough how happy I am this product actually helped, as I was honestly expecting not to notice any results.

I initially received a sample in my Birchbox in March and after using it for three days, I already noticed less blemishes and my skin was softer and dewy. I looked online and loved that this product only has natural ingredients and the reviews were great; however, I was not completely sold because as I said, I have tried every product under the sun and nothing worked for me. I decided to order the roller size of this product to let me try it out a while longer. I used the roller for a month and my skin only seemed to improve. At the end of the month I decided to bite the bullet and get the full size. At first I was hesitant because the oil is pricey, but I've decided that glowy clear skin is worth it to me. Today my boyfriend told me my skin looks better than he has ever seen it (we have been together for over 5 years) and that I looked younger (I attribute that to the glow). I love love love this oil.

I started my herbivore adventure with a week of blue tansy, then brighten. This is my go to oil for keeping breakouts at bay, reducing pimple size and controlling my oiliness.

I now have a skincare ritual I look forward to every evening. Nightly I wash with pink clay soap, alternate with blue tansy and brighten, use the pink clay mask twice a week, then apply moon fruit and either lapis or phoenix.

My skin has tightened, has a nice glow and I rarely have to use foundation (unless I'm feeling fancy)...highly recommend!",,,,

It's a very hydrating oil, smells good, and is amazing to use for a blemish breakout. I typically use it daily after my moisturizer to help seal in the moisture. Sometimes I will mix it in with a moisturizer for additional hydration. I also use it immediately after Herbivore's Blue Tansy Mask to put moisture back into my skin. It helps rid of any blemishes or hormonal breakouts I get during my period or any stressful time. It's a bit pricy for a facial oil, but it's worth every penny. And its gorgeous packaging is an extra bonus and makes my bathroom counter look good ;)",,,,

I only leave a review when I am EXCEPTIONALLY pleased or EXCEPTIONALLY mad. Today I am beyond please with this product. I have used it TWICE. only two times, one of them being today and the red spots from picking acne for YEARS is almost all gone. I got this product in my Burchbox and used it once yesterday morning and by this morning the redness was already gone to the point of being able to cover everything with a BB cream. I promptly ordered more this morning as soon as I noticed the changes. My skin looks so smooth, hydrated, and clear. No more Red spots from where I've picked my face, No more dry patches around or under my eyes, no more breakup on my nose from using bad lotions or primers. I will forever buy this product. I haven't been this happy with a product ever.",,,,

I live in Hawaii and spend my time either on planes, in the ocean, or sweating my moisturizer off, and my skin was a dry-but-oily, blotchy wreck. In the short time I've used this oil, it's nursed my face through two sunburns, a sunscreen reaction, and a couple periods and my skin has never looked or felt this good (how is it so SMOOTH?!). A bottle will last a long time -- I use 5-7 drops twice a day on damp, freshly washed skin, and it soaks in INSTANTLY. Liquid or powder foundation go on like velvet, although I've found I hardly need them anymore. Unbelievable.

The scent is gone in about 30 seconds, but I think it smells like grape jelly. In a good way. Worth every penny.",,,,

The smell and color is wonderful. I think anyone could use this oil. My skin is dry/dehydrated, but my pores get clogged easily. I also have patches of eczema on my eyelids. I haven't had any breakouts, it has reduced redness, and keeps it from getting itchy as well. The eczema on my eyelids has completely disappeared. If you're skin is drier like mine, use about 6-7 drops instead of 3-4. I also use one drop of this to mix with my loose powder concealer and it makes a wonderful little makeup serum that looks very natural.

My skin tone has been improving over the past few months, and I'm now on my second [small] bottle of Lapis oil. I use it morning and night after washing my face, and often use Orchid oil around my eyes. These facial oils are perfect. I can't say enough good things about Herbivore Botanicals.

I have combination/oily skin so I was a bit skeptical as to if this product would work for me, but I'm so happy I tried it out. I've recommended it to a friend who has struggled with acne her entire life and she told me that this oil is the only thing she has used that has actually helped to clear up her skin.

It does not completely prevents my t-zone from getting oily after mid-day, but definitely significantly reduces the oil production. I say I feel 90% less oily!!

I noticed my skin looking brighter and a little less irritated the first couple days but now after a couple of weeks my skin is amazing. My face has never liked this good.

I've spent a fortune in products hoping they would cure my acne. After the dermatologist recommended Accutane I felt hopeless and wanted to try something simple and natural. I started using this instead of moisturizer and the blue tansy mask as well. Seriously, overnight I could tell a difference. Now almost all of my acne is gone!

I was originally using coconut and almond oil but found they clogged my pores and made me break out even more. I took a chance with this and couldn't be happier! The Lapis oil got rid of my acne and redness in less than a week. After running out, I decided to try the Orchid oil and love it almost just as much. I find the Orchid to be not as hydrating, though I've always had extremely dry skin and I'm in the cold, winter months as I write this (it does smell divine though!). Both oils, however, have dramatically improved the texture and hyperpigmentation of my skin. I can't wait to try the Phoenix oil and other products. It was also important to me to find a good product in good packaging. As someone who tries to live pretty zero waste, it's great that the oils are packaged in glass, with a glass dropper, and sent in recyclable cardboard. They give a generous amount too, so I'm able to keep using them for weeks and weeks.",,,,

The pigmentation I experienced from it was probably the worst part, especially as a woman with darker complexion, it just seemed like it was never going to go away. A few months ago I tried the Charcoal Bar by HB and thought it was so amazing that I was immediately hooked on trying more products. My current regimen includes a rotation of washing my face with the Charcoal Bar or Pink Clay Bar, Blue Tansy Mask, Rose Hibiscus Mist, and of course - the Lapis Facial Oil. I first tried the Lapis Oil in the small travel sized bottle because with the $72 price point, I wanted to make sure I loved it. And alas - it has certainly lived up to the expectation like each of HB's products. Since using these products, my skin has totally transformed and is getting that clear and healthy complexion I have been longing for. It has even cleared up acne/scarring I had been getting on my back and chest which is incredible. I highly recommend these products to everyone I know, and of course the best part is knowing that they are natural! THANK YOU HERBIVORE!!",,,,

As a constant flight risk I am devastated that I have become so attached to this straight up magical potion. Currently traveling with a backpack and this bottle wrapped in bandanas a la hobo stick. Not joking, wrapped up like a christmas package and too important to throw in my backpack. How did I survive without it???? Visiting my Gma and made her try it...she says she has to have it and doesn't care how much it costs. She has very delicate skin because of chemo/lots of red patches and was hooked in one day. I have been using it for three days and I swear on my Granny that my dry patches are clearing up already and I don't have my usual solo migrating pimple. I don't like putting ANYTHING on my face because I always end up feeling greasy but this oil somehow feels totally natural if not radiant. My mother syphoned some of mine because SHE doesn't want to spend any money but has come to the conclusion that one bottle will last her a lifetime and it is better than any of the cocoa/shea butter, almond oil, grapeseed blah blah blah that she barrels through. I don't need more than three drops to evenly dose my face and I don't need to reapply in dry spots like I do with lotions. Mom also notes that it doesn't leave her smelling like she has perfumed herself, which is high on the priority list.

I've always loved facials oils and the amazing benefits from them. I've recently heard so much talk about this oil in particular, though. So...like the hardcore product junkie that I am, I had to have it ASAP! 

This oil has honestly become an absolute staple in my personal skincare routine. Also, I'm a licensed esthetician and you can bet your buns I've been telling my clients ALL about this amazingly clarifying, balancing and calming oil. 

I have combination skin that is prone to hormonal/stress related breakouts...so, if that's you--HOLLA---you've found your skin's knight in shining armor!

I work at a summer camp and am outdoors sweating for a good chunk of the day, and it's taken quite the toll on my skin. I naturally have acne-prone and combination skin, so it's always difficult to find a moisturizer that provides moisture but not oil.

I've always had blemish-prone, sensitive skin, which used to be combination and is now more dry as I enter my thirties. Lapis reduces my redness and calms any irritation, and I rarely get pimples or even blackheads anymore! I don't usually need additional moisturizer, so this has also simplified my daily routine (just wash/exfoliate and Lapis oil).

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2016-05-11,Amazing!!,I have finally found skincare that works for me thanks to Herbivore. My skin feels so much more balanced and calm using this oil and has helped reduce redness. Putting it on is so relaxing and makes your skin moisturised. Definiteley need to repurchase when it runs out!,,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2016-05-09,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This product smells absolutely incredible. I personally have been using oils to moisturize my face for a while but nothing I've found goes on as easily as this without me having to pull my skin around. It really does reduce the amount of redness on my face, and I wish it wasn't so expensive so I could use it as a body oil it's just THAT soft. I have never felt skin so soft in my entire life. And it smells utterly heavenly. I can't wait to buy the full collection!!",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2016-05-05,Wish I got this sooner!,"I've had some horrible breakouts lately, and it seems as though my face now has permanent red spots and bumps. Nothing was helping but the Blue Clay mask, but I wanted something more convenient to use. I noticed a change in my skin within the first 2 days of using. The red spots are fading and so are the bumps. I'm using less and less concealer everyday and I love that. I was nervous about using it under makeup but my makeup actually lasted longer and my skin is a lot less oily. Hopefully it will continue to get less oily as I use it. I love the glow it gives my skin and the scent is really nice, it may not be for everyone but it's very light. I'm definitely going to try the other oils now!",,,,

What I determined was that both are amazing oils for skin. The Lapis oil targets redness and purifies the skin. And while I love both, both oils leave skin plump and youthful, I loved the Orchid slightly better. I would recommend getting both oils however, so you can have the best of both worlds --calming and glowing.",,,,

My acne started clearing up and even in the humid Georgia heat my face was actually less oily!!

Now, at almost 29, I couldn't stand the thought of using the same harsh prescriptions going into my 30s. I've broken out from facial oils before so I was skeptical about this one, but it really is amazing. Within a week of using it, my breakouts calmed, my skin was less red and the dry patches I always had around my mouth and nose were gone. I also received compliments on my skin from friends and acquaintances who were eager to know what I was using. I haven't touch my prescriptions since and I don't plan to.

I am absolutely totally obsessed with this stuff. First of all, I have extremely dry sensitive fair skin. Prone to redness, irritation, flaking and hormonal breakouts. Prone to all of the things really. But that's not even it.... Also my skin has recently been so oily throughout the day that I have to reset my makeup multiple times. It was getting ridiculous. If I didn't moisturize, I would get so flaky and red. But if I did moisturize my makeup would melt off of my face all day long. Long story short, I work in skincare and have used literally everything. This oil not only calmed my skin down immediately!..... Within one week of use my skin is the best it has been in years. It does everything! It completely tames redness, heals up any blemishes, is AHMAZING under makeup too!.... I literally cannot say enough. I am completely hooked and obsessed!!",,,,

I recently started working in an office environment (boo, cube life!) and my skin did not react well. I use this product once daily after washing my face with the pink clay bar soap (not immediately after). My skin has never looked or felt better. The smell alone is to die for! And I've only had it for about two weeks. I can't wait to see the long-term results. Don't stress over the price - this beauty is worth every penny. I'm never going back to anything else ever.

I've been using it now for over a week and it does exactly what I need it to do. 
My skin is acne prone and I always wear sunscreen during the day. My plan for this oil was to use by itself and as an additive to my sunscreen and it works both ways like a charm. 
I'm 37 years old and have been using oils for years in an attempt to replenish suppleness and combat wrinkles. They really work and I think I have found my new favorite line. 
I will be purchasing Phoenix oil next to use at night.",,,,
https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2016-03-15,The benefits will show immediately.,"I ordered this oil with the Blue Clay (I got the Blue Tansy instead, I guess they mistaken that for the other but it's okay) to rescue my oily and acne prone skin. 
This Lapis Oil that is supposed to control oil truly works and moisturize my skin.
I could already tell by the first day of use!

Although I needed to pay custom fees plus expensive shipping here in Italy (that costed me 50€ to get these goodies home)
I really wish they had them in Sephora.it or physical stores in Milan. 

I hope they last me a long time before I need to repurchase!",,,,

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,5,2016-02-25,Blown Away.,"Let me start off by saying that I have dry/dehydrated skin with eczema on my eyelids and neck (how lovely). I am prone to congestion on my chin, but really no issues with acne. Since this oil is targeted for more oilier skin types, I thought this oil would be very light and wouldn't help my dry, flaky skin.. WRONG. This has made my face so soft and plump, I'm not even joking. I am super sensitive and I have had no reaction to this oil. For the record, I have never had a reaction from any HB product. I am just in love. The blue color just adds to the beautiful experience with this oil. Also, my face has been recovering from a reaction that I had to a new face wash; flaky, bright red, and very tight with a uncomfortable burning sensation around my nose and cheeks. The Phoenix and Orchid oils really helped my skin to get back to normal (I didn't have the lapis oil at the time). I can't brag enough about this product. I will for sure be buying the full size bottle.",,,,

I get pimples on my forehead from stress and certain (bad/unhealthy) foods, as well as a few here and there on my cheeks from the changing seasons, and I swear Lapis really balances and helps heal and maybe even prevent. I'm two weeks in and have been using this one in rotation with the other two oils, as well as my other products, and I will be coming back for more when I run out. It's fab.",,,,

It is nice and light enough that I can use it during the daytime (especially with my combination/dry/sensitive winter skin). And after two weeks of using it I'm noticing that the redness of any to-be acne is not as obvious as before. Say goodbye to snake-like peeling and bright-red spot on my face!,,,,

Even after a couple days of using the Lapis Facial Oil my skin feels super balanced and that is no easy task. I am always struggling to balance my skin between all my dry patches, redness and the occasional breakout and this product finally is doing that for me. Also you can wear under makeup (just rub in thoroughly and let dry). Most facial oils I have encountered do not wear well under makeup but the Lapis Oil is amazing for day or night and under makeup it doesn't get creasy.",,,,

I never dealt with acne, I'm 27years old and after a bad birth control prescription all hell broke loose. I'm ashamed to same I spent hundreds of dollars on products with no real results. I finally found a good skincare line that has really helped with inflammation and calming down the giant cystic pimples that would pop up daily. Then I came across herbivores on Instagram and decided to add to my routine. I've only been using this oil for a few days and even though I've been getting good results with my skincare routine this has taken it over the top. My makeup applies better, the redness around my chin has gone down, and even the scarring left behind from the cystic acne have started to lighten. I use this at night before applying my moisturizer and I'm really impressed. My acne products can be drying so this gives great moisture and really radiates my skin.",,,,

I have combination-oily skin that usually becomes oily within an hour or two, so I figured this oil would be the most suitable of the three for me. I've been using this product for a week, and it has already made such a dramatic improvement in my skin. I applied the oil at 8:30 this morning, and by 4:30 in the afternoon there was no sign of any oil on my face - not even on my chin or nose, where it tends to be the most oily. My chin in particular is very acne-prone, and I have been noticing fewer breakouts there since I started using this product. 100% recommend.",,,,

It has been great for my oily skin and keeps me very hydrated. I have been able to tell my complexion is smoother and more even since wearing this oil. It's very lightweight, non greasy, and only takes a few drops (4-6) for your whole face. This product should last me at least a year. The smell is lovely. The blue tansy is the strongest component, in my opinion. It's fragrance is somewhat minty and therapeutic. It's not overpowering at all. If you are familiar with May Lindstrom, the scent will remind you of her ""Blue Cacoon."" I'm a huge fan of May's and have several of her products and adore them but in my opinion, this is more hydrating than the Blue Cacoon and not to mention, a better value.

I don't have a beard, but I do have the occasional stubble-- and the oil seems to sit on top of the hairs instead of absorbing into that area of my face. I take a good five minutes to massage a quarter of the applicator's worth of product into my face and down my neck.

My aesthetician insists to never put oil on my face but I have defied her for this bottle. 

I started using lapis and ended up breaking out everywhere. I couldn't tell if I were purging or having a bad reaction. So I decided to get a full facial extraction and only use the oil on one side to properly test its effects. Four days later, I ended up with my usual whiteheads on the oil-free side and my lapis side was glowing with much less whiteheads. Overall, impressive but expect to purge.

https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/collections/all/products/clearly-bright-nova-15-vitamin-c-serum-lapis-face-oil,4,2016-08-14,Tricky Oil,"I really struggled with this oil! I have an oily T-zone with larger pores and a chin that likes to break out monthly, you know what I mean. I would never ever call any part of my skin dry or say I had true acne. I bought the roller ball set of all 3 oils. 

When I first used this oil, I would apply it all over my T-zone to help ward of oil during the day, along with the Pheonix Oil around my face and apply moisturizer over the top. It dried out my skin near my eyes and me cheeks so bad I thought I was having an allergic reaction. It looked like hives. I'm allergic to Ragweed so it's possible I could have reacted to the related Blue Tansy/Chamomile. 

After a LOT of trail and error I have found this oil only works OVER moisturizer for me. Now my routine is thus: Phenonix everywhere, Orchid on drier areas like cheeks or breakouts, eye cream, cream moisturizer THEN Lapis oil on t-zone, breakouts or irritated skin. 

Now that I have it figured out, the anti-inflammatory properties have really gone to work and have actually helped to heal the spots it had previously been irritating. 

If you're struggling with not making the product work for you or feel like it's making your skin worse, I highly suggest changing the order of your products. Skincare isn't one size fits all.",,,,

Since this is the only thing I changed since last winter, I'm crediting this product. It is supposed to be purifying, so maybe it's a little too drying for my sensitive skin during the winter. I'll put it away until spring/summer and use it only during the warmer months when my skin needs less hydration and more purification.

i used the mask, would wash/exfoliate, then would use the oil all before bedtime.

my acne immediately worsened. i thought my skin was purging, so i stuck it out and continued using these products for about 3 months. (mask 4x a week, lapis every night).

my skin improved very slightly for a while, but after about a month it returned to its former state and has consistently been acne prone. i also developed small bumps around my smile lines that were colorless, but irritating.

i do have dry skin, and the lapis oil has been great for hydration. i do not think it is effective at treating acne, especially not blackheads.

I used the oil day and night before my regular moisturizer for 5 days in a row now and I noticed increase in acne. I have cystic acne on my jawline and a lot of whiteheads around my nose and forehead. I have a really bumpy skin texture on my forehead and nose now. I’m sure this oil clogged my pores. This lapis oil and blue tansy mask are the only change I made in my skincare routine. I used another facial oil in the past and it never breaks me out like this. It’s amazing how it destroyed my skin in 5 days.

I was hoping this oil would smooth out my complexion and keep the hormonal acne at bay. The first few days using it my face was fine, then I would wake up every morning with a new zit or a few new zits. I continued to use it thinking maybe this is the initial stage before my skin gets used to it and the oil starts working miracles, but it didnt. It also made my blackheads unmanageable and the worst they have been in my entire life! I used it was a little over a month, just hoping and praying it would somehow turn around, but I have officially given up. As soon as I stopped using it, the whiteheads and zits stopped appearing so I know it was the oil because that is all I had changed in my regime.
